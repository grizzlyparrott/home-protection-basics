<h1>What to Do After a Burglary</h1>

<p>
A burglary dumps you straight into crisis mode—your home violated, belongings missing, and your mind scrambling to figure out what to do first. This guide strips it down to the critical steps that matter: securing your home, documenting theft correctly, and positioning your insurance claim so you don’t get underpaid.
</p>

<p>
Before going any further, understand how theft sub-limits work. Items like jewelry and firearms hit low caps fast—see <a href="personal-property-limits-explained">personal property limits</a> so you know what to expect during the claim.
</p>

<h2>1. Don’t Touch Anything Yet</h2>

<p>
Your instinct may be to clean up or look through everything, but stop. The scene tells a story—how the burglar entered, what route they took, and what they handled.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not fix the door or window yet</li>
  <li>Do not rearrange items</li>
  <li>Do not start cleaning</li>
</ul>

<p>
Insurance adjusters and police both rely on untouched evidence.
</p>

<h2>2. Call the Police and File a Report</h2>

<p>
A theft claim without a police report is dead on arrival. Insurers require it.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>File the report immediately</li>
  <li>Include serial numbers when possible</li>
  <li>List all items missing, even if you aren’t 100% sure yet</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can update the report later with additional items.
</p>

<h2>3. Record the Damage Before You Fix Anything</h2>

<p>
Take clear photos and videos of:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entry points</li>
  <li>Damaged locks and frames</li>
  <li>Ransacked rooms</li>
  <li>Missing-item locations</li>
</ul>

<p>
Adjusters rely heavily on visual documentation—weak evidence equals weak payouts.
</p>

<h2>4. Create a Detailed Theft Inventory</h2>

<p>
Your list must be specific. “Jewelry” is not a claimable item. “14k gold chain, 20-inch, purchased 2019” is.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Item name + description</li>
  <li>Brand/model</li>
  <li>Approximate age</li>
  <li>Estimated value</li>
  <li>Receipts or photos if available</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you have nothing documented yet, learn how to rebuild proof fast using <a href="creating-a-home-inventory-video">inventory video basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>5. Understand What Insurance Will Actually Pay</h2>

<p>
Homeowners insurance covers burglary—but within limits:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Electronics: usually covered fully</li>
  <li>Cash: extremely low limit ($100–$200)</li>
  <li>Jewelry: theft caps, often $1,500 total</li>
  <li>Firearms: separate sub-limits</li>
  <li>Tools and gear: varies widely</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the burglar targeted valuables, review <a href="scheduling-high-value-items">how to schedule high-value items</a> so the same loss never hurts this bad again.
</p>

<h2>6. Prevent Secondary Losses</h2>

<p>
Burglars usually damage doors, frames, and locks. Once evidence is documented:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Secure doors and windows immediately</li>
  <li>Replace locks or rekey the home</li>
  <li>Repair broken glass</li>
</ul>

<p>
Insurers view additional damage caused by delay as negligence.
</p>

<h2>7. Submit Your Claim Quickly</h2>

<p>
Burglary claims move smoother when filed fast, with organized evidence.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Police report</li>
  <li>Photos and videos</li>
  <li>Detailed inventory</li>
  <li>Receipts for stolen items if available</li>
  <li>Repair estimates for entry damage</li>
</ul>

<p>
Respond quickly to adjuster questions. Slow replies drag out the process unnecessarily.
</p>

<h2>8. Strengthen Home Security After the Incident</h2>

<p>
Burglars often return if they think the home is still vulnerable. Reinforce what failed:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Install a better deadbolt or strike plate</li>
  <li>Add an outdoor camera covering entry points</li>
  <li>Upgrade window locks</li>
  <li>Improve lighting near doors</li>
  <li>Secure or hide high-value items</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is also the right time to review your policy limits—pair this article with <a href="understanding-insurance-exclusions">exclusions</a> so you aren’t surprised by future gaps.
</p>

<h2>9. The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
After a burglary, your job is simple: document everything, secure the home, file fast, and avoid mistakes that hand the insurer an excuse to underpay. A clean, well-supported claim gets reimbursed. A sloppy one gets picked apart.

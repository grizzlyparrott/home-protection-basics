  <h1>Insurance Cancellation Reasons</h1>

  <p>
    Insurance companies cancel or non-renew policies for one reason: they want to cut their risk. They run the numbers constantly, and if a home becomes too risky—or too costly—they drop it. This guide explains why insurers pull the plug and how to stay off the chopping block.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you don’t already understand how insurers judge your property, skim <a href="how-insurers-evaluate-risk">how insurers evaluate risk</a>. Every cancellation ties back to those same scoring factors.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Multiple Claims (Especially Water or Liability)</h2>

  <p>
    Claims follow you for years. Too many in a short period paints you as a high-risk customer, and insurers don’t hesitate to cut ties.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Two or more claims in 3 years is the danger zone</li>
    <li>Water damage claims are the most common cancellation trigger</li>
    <li>Liability claims (dog bites, falls) can trigger immediate non-renewal</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Before filing anything small, read <a href="claims-vs-premium-impact">claims vs premium impact</a>. A $2,000 payout can cost far more in long-term consequences.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Failing a Home Inspection</h2>

  <p>
    Many insurers inspect the home shortly after binding the policy. If the inspector finds serious safety or maintenance issues, you may get a cancellation notice within weeks.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Old or damaged roofs</li>
    <li>Exposed wiring</li>
    <li>Rotting steps, rails, or decks</li>
    <li>Overhanging or dead trees</li>
    <li>Evidence of long-term water damage</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you haven't read it yet, <a href="home-insurance-inspection-basics">inspection basics</a> explains exactly what inspectors look for.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Roof Age or Condition</h2>

  <p>
    This is one of the most common cancellation reasons nationwide. If the roof is old, brittle, or storm-damaged, insurers may refuse renewal until it’s replaced.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Roofs 15–20+ years old are high risk</li>
    <li>Hail or wind damage that hasn't been repaired is a red flag</li>
    <li>Missing shingles or sagging sections are immediate issues</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Review <a href="roof-age-and-insurance-impact">roof impact basics</a> to see why insurers take this so seriously.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Dangerous Property Conditions</h2>

  <p>
    Anything that increases liability risk becomes a cancellation candidate if left unaddressed.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Pools without fencing</li>
    <li>Aggressive or restricted dog breeds</li>
    <li>Broken steps or loose handrails</li>
    <li>Significant yard hazards</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Liability losses are expensive. If you have these risks, make sure your <a href="liability-coverage-basics">liability coverage</a> is strong—and the hazards are corrected quickly.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Non-Payment of Premium</h2>

  <p>
    This one is obvious but common. Missed payments or returned payments can trigger immediate cancellation.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Set autopay if your budget allows</li>
    <li>Watch for billing changes at renewal</li>
    <li>Make sure your mortgage escrow is paying correctly</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Fraud or Misrepresentation</h2>

  <p>
    If an insurer discovers that the application contained false information—whether intentional or accidental—they may rescind coverage or cancel immediately.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Incorrect roof age</li>
    <li>Wrong square footage</li>
    <li>Not disclosing a pool or trampoline</li>
    <li>Misstated occupancy (renters vs primary residence)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. High-Risk Renovations</h2>

  <p>
    Certain upgrades increase rebuild cost or liability—and insurers react fast if you don’t notify them.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Major additions</li>
    <li>Basement finishing</li>
    <li>Pools and hot tubs</li>
    <li>Roof changes or materials not meeting standards</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you're renovating, pair this with <a href="home-upgrades-that-affect-premiums">upgrades that affect premiums</a> to stay ahead of the insurer’s expectations.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Area Risk Changes</h2>

  <p>
    You can lose coverage even if your home is perfect. If your region becomes unprofitable due to wildfire, hail, or flood activity, insurers may pull out of entire ZIP codes.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Wildfire-prone states</li>
    <li>Hail belts</li>
    <li>Hurricane zones</li>
    <li>Rising crime areas</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This has nothing to do with you—and everything to do with insurer survival.
  </p>

  <h2>9. What to Do If You Receive a Cancellation or Non-Renewal Notice</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Call the insurer immediately and ask for the specific reason</li>
    <li>Fix whatever can be corrected quickly (roof patch, debris clearing, rail repair)</li>
    <li>Gather documentation proving repairs</li>
    <li>Ask if the insurer will reinstate after verification</li>
    <li>Start shopping for a replacement policy immediately</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Don’t wait. A cancellation makes future policies more expensive, so act fast and get ahead of it.

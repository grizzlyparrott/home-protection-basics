  <h1>Liability Coverage Basics</h1>

  <p>
    Liability coverage is the part of your homeowners policy that protects you from the financial fallout of injuring someone or damaging their property. One accident—one fall, one bite, one mistake—can turn into a five-figure or six-figure lawsuit fast. This coverage is the line between a bad day and a ruined financial future.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want the full picture of how liability fits into the rest of your policy, see the tactical guide on <a href="homeowners-insurance-coverage-explained">homeowners insurance coverage</a> for context.
  </p>

  <h2>1. What Liability Coverage Actually Protects</h2>

  <p>
    Liability kicks in when you or a household member accidentally injure someone else or damage their property. It does not cover your own injuries or your own property—only the other party’s losses.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Slip-and-fall injuries on your property</li>
    <li>Dog bites and animal-related injuries</li>
    <li>You damage someone else’s property (accidentally)</li>
    <li>Claims filed by guests after medical treatment</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These are the exact claims where lawyers get involved quickly. Having enough liability coverage makes those conversations short.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Medical Payments Coverage (Small, But Useful)</h2>

  <p>
    Med-pay is the “pressure relief valve” of your policy. It pays small medical bills for minor injuries—no fault questions asked. This prevents small accidents from escalating into lawsuits.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Common limits: $1,000–$5,000</li>
    <li>Applies to guests, not household members</li>
    <li>Useful for cuts, sprains, or urgent-care visits</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Where Liability Coverage Stops (Critical Boundaries)</h2>

  <p>
    Liability has hard exclusions—cross these lines and the policy won’t defend you or pay for anything.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Intentional harm (anything deliberate)</li>
    <li>Damage from business activities at home</li>
    <li>Car accidents (your auto policy handles that)</li>
    <li>Injuries to you or family members</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you run any type of business from home—repairs, childcare, rentals—read the guide on <a href="insurance-for-rental-properties">rental property insurance</a> so you’re not unknowingly uninsured.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Why Your Liability Limit Probably Isn't High Enough</h2>

  <p>
    Most homeowners stick with the default: $100,000. That number made sense 20 years ago. Today, a simple fracture with surgery can clear $40k. Add legal fees, lost wages, and long-term medical needs—it’s nothing.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>$300k–$500k is the realistic minimum for most households.</li>
    <li>Umbrella policies stack on top cheaply if you need more.</li>
    <li>Premium difference between low and high limits is tiny.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Liability coverage is the cheapest part of your policy to max out. Cutting corners here is a bad gamble.
  </p>

  <h2>5. How Claims Actually Play Out</h2>

  <p>
    When someone gets hurt, their medical provider or attorney often files the claim—not the person themselves. Liability claims move fast, and insurers investigate aggressively because the stakes are high.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Expect recorded statements</li>
    <li>Expect scrutiny around negligence</li>
    <li>Expect requests for documentation (photos, witnesses, etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Clean documentation—especially if the injury involved hazards like flooring, stairs, or pets—reduces arguments. The guide on <a href="documenting-your-home-for-insurance">documenting your home</a> helps with that.
  </p>

  <h2>6. When to Review Your Liability Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    Anytime your life circumstances change, reevaluate your limits. More assets or more visitors means more exposure.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>New dog or large pet</li>
    <li>New pool or trampoline</li>
    <li>Regular hosting or gatherings</li>
    <li>High net worth or rental property ownership</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If a guest ends up injured on your property, liability coverage becomes the only thing between you and a major financial problem. Set it right now, not after something happens.

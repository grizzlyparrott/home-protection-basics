  <h1>Flood Insurance Basics</h1>

  <p>
    Flooding is the most misunderstood—and most financially devastating—gap in home insurance. Homeowners policies <strong>do not cover rising water</strong>. Not sometimes. Not partially. Never. Every major storm proves this when thousands of homeowners learn the hard way that they needed a separate flood policy.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’re unsure which parts of your home would actually be protected during water damage, review the breakdown of <a href="dwelling-coverage-basics">dwelling coverage</a> to understand where standard policies draw the line.
  </p>

  <h2>1. What Counts as a “Flood” (FEMA’s Definition)</h2>

  <p>
    Flood insurance only triggers when water meets FEMA’s official definition of a flood. That definition is strict:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Water covers at least two acres of normally dry land, <strong>or</strong></li>
    <li>Water affects at least two properties (yours + another)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The key is <strong>rising water from outside</strong>. If water comes up from the ground, the street, or nearby drainage—it’s a flood. Homeowners insurance will deny it 100% of the time.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What Flood Insurance Actually Covers</h2>

  <p>
    Flood insurance focuses on damage directly caused by rising water. It does not behave like a homeowners policy—coverage is narrower and more defined.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Foundation and structure</li>
    <li>Electrical and plumbing systems</li>
    <li>HVAC, water heaters, and furnaces</li>
    <li>Flooring, walls, and insulation</li>
    <li>Appliances (if on the approved list)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Personal property is covered only if you add contents coverage, and even then, the list is limited. For a better understanding of how belongings are normally covered, see <a href="personal-property-coverage-basics">personal property coverage</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3. What Flood Insurance Does NOT Cover</h2>

  <p>
    Flood policies have hard exclusions. These are the ones that surprise homeowners the most:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Basement improvements (carpet, drywall, finished walls)</li>
    <li>Personal property stored in a basement</li>
    <li>Temporary housing costs (ALE is not included)</li>
    <li>Landscaping or exterior structures not attached to the home</li>
    <li>Mold, unless directly caused by a covered flood and mitigated quickly</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Flood insurance is designed to stabilize a structure—not restore luxury finishes or basement conversions.
  </p>

  <h2>4. The Two Sources of Flood Policies: NFIP vs Private</h2>

  <p>
    You can buy flood insurance from:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>NFIP (FEMA)</strong> — standardized coverage, strict limits</li>
    <li><strong>Private insurers</strong> — often higher limits and broader protection</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    NFIP is predictable but capped. Private flood fills gaps that FEMA will never touch. If your home is high-value or fully finished, private flood may be necessary.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Elevation, Zoning, and Risk: Why Your Premium Looks the Way It Does</h2>

  <p>
    Flood insurance pricing is cold, math-driven, and based on actual risk factors:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Elevation above base flood level</li>
    <li>Distance to rivers, washes, or drainage paths</li>
    <li>Past flood events in your zone</li>
    <li>Foundation type (slab, crawlspace, basement)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Risk-based pricing means that even people “outside the flood zone” can flood—and increasingly do. Storm intensity makes the old maps outdated.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Why You Probably Need Flood Insurance Even If It’s Not “Required”</h2>

  <p>
    FEMA’s own data is brutal: <strong>25% of all flood claims come from low- and moderate-risk zones.</strong> These homeowners thought they were safe until one storm overwhelmed local drainage and pushed water into neighborhoods that hadn’t flooded in decades.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A single inch of water can cause $20,000+ in damage.</li>
    <li>FEMA and homeowners insurance will not cover rising water.</li>
    <li>Disaster assistance—if offered—is usually a small loan, not a payout.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Flood insurance is one of the only ways to stop a water disaster from turning into financial ruin.
  </p>

  <h2>7. When to Reevaluate Your Flood Risk</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>After new construction or development alters drainage</li>
    <li>After severe storms or “100-year” events nearby</li>
    <li>After changes in FEMA flood maps</li>
    <li>Anytime your home value increases significantly</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Risk changes. Your coverage should too.

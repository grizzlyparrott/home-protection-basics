  <h1>What Does Renters Insurance Actually Cover?</h1>

  <p>
    Renters insurance protects <strong>your belongings</strong>, <strong>your liability exposure</strong>, and
    <strong>your temporary living costs</strong> if a covered loss forces you out of your unit. It does not protect the building itself—that’s the landlord’s job.
  </p>

  <p>
    The structure of renters insurance closely mirrors homeowners insurance (minus dwelling coverage). If you want to compare them side-by-side,
    check <a href="homeowners-insurance-coverage-explained.html">homeowners insurance coverage explained</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Personal Property Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    This is the core of your renters policy. It pays to replace belongings damaged or stolen due to covered causes such as fire, smoke, certain water leaks, vandalism, and theft.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Furniture, clothing, electronics, and tools</li>
    <li>Items stolen from your vehicle (policy limits may apply)</li>
    <li>Belongings temporarily away from home, such as luggage</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    High-value categories (jewelry, firearms, collectibles) typically have sub-limits.  
    A deeper explanation of those limits is in 
    <a href="personal-property-coverage-basics.html">personal property coverage basics</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Liability Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    Liability coverage protects you financially if you accidentally injure someone or damage their property. It does not apply to your own injuries or your own belongings.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A guest trips in your apartment and needs medical treatment</li>
    <li>Your dog bites a visitor</li>
    <li>You accidentally damage a friend’s property</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you don’t know whether your liability limit is high enough, read
    <a href="liability-coverage-basics.html">liability coverage basics</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Medical Payments Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    A small, no-fault coverage that pays for minor guest injuries regardless of responsibility. It’s meant to resolve small problems quickly.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Typically $1,000–$5,000 per person</li>
    <li>Does not apply to you or household members</li>
    <li>Not intended for major medical events</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Loss of Use Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    If your rental becomes unlivable after a covered loss, this pays for hotel stays, short-term rentals, and increased daily expenses.
  </p>

  <p>
    A more detailed breakdown is available in 
    <a href="loss-of-use-coverage-basics.html">loss of use coverage basics</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5. What the Landlord’s Policy Covers Instead</h2>

  <p>
    Your landlord’s insurance covers the building, roof, common systems, and their liability—not your belongings. If the building burns, the landlord rebuilds the structure; your renters policy replaces your stuff and covers temporary housing.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Landlord:</strong> structure, exterior, common areas</li>
    <li><strong>You:</strong> belongings, liability, hotel/living expenses</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. What Renters Insurance Does Not Cover</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Flooding from rising water — requires separate flood insurance</li>
    <li>Earthquake damage unless you added an endorsement</li>
    <li>Wear and tear, pests, or maintenance failures</li>
    <li>Business property beyond small limits</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you’re renting while also owning rental property yourself, compare this with 
    <a href="insurance-for-rental-properties.html">insurance for rental properties</a>
    to understand how the policies interact.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Quick Renters Insurance Checkup</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Ensure your personal property limit roughly matches replacement cost</li>
    <li>Check sub-limits for jewelry, firearms, and collectibles</li>
    <li>Raise liability limits if they’re at the minimum</li>
    <li>Review coverage yearly or after major purchases</li>
  </ul>

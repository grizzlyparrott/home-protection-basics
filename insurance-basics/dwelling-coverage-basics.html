  <h1>Dwelling Coverage Basics</h1>

  <p>
    Dwelling coverage is the backbone of your homeowners policy. It’s the part that pays to repair or rebuild your home after a covered loss. If this number is wrong—or you misunderstand what triggers coverage—you’re setting yourself up for a nasty surprise when damage actually happens.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want the bigger picture of how the rest of your policy ties in, the tactical guide on <a href="homeowners-insurance-coverage-explained">homeowners insurance coverage</a> shows how all the coverage parts work together.
  </p>

  <h2>1. What Dwelling Coverage Actually Protects</h2>

  <p>
    Dwelling coverage protects the physical structure of your home: walls, roof, floors, built-ins, and anything attached. If a covered peril hits these elements, this coverage pays out—after your deductible.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Attached garage or carport</li>
    <li>Built-in cabinets, counters, and fixtures</li>
    <li>Plumbing, wiring, HVAC</li>
    <li>Roofing and structural framing</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Coverage is triggered by <strong>sudden, accidental</strong> damage. Slow leaks, rot, foundation settling, and neglect don’t qualify—those are instantly denied because they fall under homeowner maintenance.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Choosing the Right Coverage Amount</h2>

  <p>
    Your dwelling limit must match what it would cost to rebuild your home today, not what you owe on it, and not what Zillow says it’s worth. Rebuild cost is usually higher than market value. If this number is wrong, everything downstream is wrong.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Pick the limit based on rebuild cost, not sale price.</li>
    <li>Factor in rising labor and material cost—insurers adjust slowly.</li>
    <li>If you remodeled or added square footage, raise the limit immediately.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When your limit is too low, the insurer can apply a “co-insurance penalty,” which cuts your payout even during partial losses. Most homeowners don’t learn this until it’s too late.
  </p>

  <h2>3. What’s Not Covered (Where Homeowners Slip Up)</h2>

  <p>
    Dwelling coverage has clear exclusions that catch people off guard. If the cause of loss falls into one of these categories, the insurer shuts it down immediately.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Flooding from rising water — requires a flood policy.</li>
    <li>Earthquake or ground movement — separate coverage.</li>
    <li>Wear, tear, deterioration, and rot — denied on sight.</li>
    <li>Damage from long-term leaks — considered neglect.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you live in an area prone to natural disasters, pair this with the breakdowns on <a href="flood-insurance-basics">flood coverage</a> and <a href="earthquake-insurance-basics">earthquake coverage</a> so you’re not relying on a policy that won’t respond.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Replacement Cost vs. Actual Cash Value</h2>

  <p>
    Some policies rebuild your home at today’s cost. Others pay actual cash value—basically “used home value”—which is far lower. If your home is insured on ACV, you’re setting yourself up for major out-of-pocket loss.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Replacement Cost:</strong> pays what it costs to rebuild.</li>
    <li><strong>Actual Cash Value:</strong> subtracts depreciation (and hurts).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For a deeper comparison, see the guide on <a href="actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost">ACV vs. replacement cost</a>. It’s one of the biggest claim-outcome differences in the entire policy.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Why Documentation Still Matters Here</h2>

  <p>
    Even though dwelling coverage focuses on the structure, insurers still want proof—especially for borderline damage like roof issues or partial leaks. Good documentation shuts down “pre-existing damage” arguments fast.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Take dated photos after major upgrades or repairs.</li>
    <li>Save receipts from contractors and materials.</li>
    <li>Keep before/after pictures of any remodel.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you want a clean, ready-to-use method, follow the tactical guide on <a href="documenting-your-home-for-insurance">documenting your home</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>6. When to Review or Update Your Dwelling Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    Dwelling coverage should never be a set-and-forget number. Revisit it yearly or whenever you make changes to your home.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>After upgrades, additions, or major repairs</li>
    <li>After big changes in local construction costs</li>
    <li>At every policy renewal</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A quick check now saves you from a nasty co-insurance penalty later.

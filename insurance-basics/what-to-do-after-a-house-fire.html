<h1>What to Do After a House Fire</h1>

<p>
A house fire turns your life upside down in seconds. Your job right after is simple: stay safe, secure the property, and document everything before the insurer shows up. A fire claim is one of the largest payouts a carrier can make, so they scrutinize these losses heavily. The cleaner your documentation, the faster and fuller the payout.
</p>

<p>
If you haven’t studied how losses are documented, skim <a href="documenting-a-loss-properly">loss documentation basics</a>. Fire claims depend on airtight records.
</p>

<h2>1. Don’t Re-Enter Until the Fire Department Clears It</h2>

<p>
Hotspots can reignite, structural components may be unstable, and smoke inhalation can be deadly. Do not go back inside until firefighters say it’s safe.
</p>

<h2>2. Secure the Property Immediately</h2>

<p>
Once cleared, your responsibility shifts to preventing further damage. Insurers deny claims when homeowners fail to mitigate additional loss.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Board up broken windows and doors</li>
  <li>Cover exposed sections with tarps</li>
  <li>Shut off utilities if they weren’t already</li>
</ul>

<p>
Any damage that happens after the fire because the home was left open is on you.
</p>

<h2>3. Document the Scene Before Moving Anything</h2>

<p>
Your photos and videos serve as the baseline evidence for the entire claim. Capture:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exterior damage from all four sides</li>
  <li>Roof condition</li>
  <li>Every room, even lightly damaged ones</li>
  <li>Close-ups of appliances, wiring, furniture, and belongings</li>
</ul>

<p>
Adjusters will use these images to verify the extent of the loss. Don’t skip anything.
</p>

<h2>4. File Your Claim as Soon as Possible</h2>

<p>
Fire claims move faster when filed early. Provide:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A copy of the fire report</li>
  <li>Your photo and video documentation</li>
  <li>A list of damaged rooms and items</li>
</ul>

<p>
Respond to adjuster questions quickly. Delays slow payment and cleanup.
</p>

<h2>5. Create a Detailed Inventory of Damaged Items</h2>

<p>
Your insurer needs a full list of what burned, melted, or was smoke-damaged. List everything room by room:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Electronics</li>
  <li>Furniture</li>
  <li>Clothing</li>
  <li>Tools and appliances</li>
  <li>Personal items</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you aren’t sure how to organize an inventory, look at <a href="home-inventory-checklist">inventory basics</a> for structure.
</p>

<h2>6. Don’t Throw Anything Away Yet</h2>

<p>
Even destroyed items matter. Adjusters may need to physically inspect debris to confirm type, brand, or condition.
</p>

<p>
Bag small items. Leave large items in place until the adjuster clears them for disposal.
</p>

<h2>7. Use a Professional Mitigation Company</h2>

<p>
With fires, smoke and soot do far more hidden damage than people realize. Mitigation companies have the tools to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove soot safely</li>
  <li>Deodorize rooms and materials</li>
  <li>Prevent corrosive damage to electronics and metal</li>
  <li>Dry water used during firefighting</li>
</ul>

<p>
Insurers prefer licensed professionals because improper DIY cleanup can worsen structural damage.
</p>

<h2>8. Understand Coverage for Fire Losses</h2>

<p>
Fire is usually covered fully under dwelling and personal property coverage, but limits still matter.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dwelling coverage:</strong> repairs structural damage</li>
  <li><strong>Personal property:</strong> covers belongings</li>
  <li><strong>Loss of use:</strong> pays for temporary housing</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you don’t understand these sections fully, review <a href="homeowners-insurance-coverage-explained">coverage basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>9. Prevent Secondary Losses</h2>

<p>
Your responsibility doesn’t end after the flames are out. Keep damage from spreading:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dry wet areas immediately</li>
  <li>Ventilate where possible</li>
  <li>Remove salvageable items from soot-heavy rooms</li>
  <li>Keep tarps secure in wind or rain</li>
</ul>

<h2>10. The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
After a fire, the first 48 hours determine how smoothly your claim goes. Secure the home, document every inch, file fast, and avoid cleaning or tossing items until the adjuster signs off. A disciplined response protects both your payout and your home’s recovery.

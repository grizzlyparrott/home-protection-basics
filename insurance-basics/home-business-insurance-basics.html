  <h1>Home Business Insurance Basics</h1>

  <p>
    Running a business from home doesn’t mean your homeowners insurance has your back. In fact, most home-based business losses are excluded. If your equipment gets stolen, if a product injures someone, or if a client slips on your walkway, a standard homeowners policy is going to deny it—and they’ll be right.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before you assume you’re covered, review <a href="understanding-insurance-exclusions">insurance exclusions</a>. Home businesses hit nearly every category insurers refuse to touch.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Homeowners Insurance Covers Almost None of Your Business</h2>

  <p>
    This is the part homeowners misunderstand. Homeowners insurance is designed for personal use—not commercial activity.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Business equipment coverage caps at $2,500 inside the home</li>
    <li>Only $500 is covered if equipment is stolen from your vehicle</li>
    <li>Product liability is excluded</li>
    <li>Business inventory is excluded</li>
    <li>Business interruption is excluded</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you rely on your equipment or inventory to make money, this is a massive blind spot.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Liability for Clients or Customers Is NOT Covered</h2>

  <p>
    If you have customers visiting your home—tax clients, tutoring students, hair clients, etc.—your homeowners policy won’t cover you if they’re injured.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Slip-and-fall incidents → excluded</li>
    <li>Professional liability → excluded</li>
    <li>Negligence while performing work → excluded</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Liability losses can bankrupt a small business fast. If you need a refresher on liability mechanics, see <a href="liability-coverage-basics">liability coverage basics</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3. You Need a Home-Based Business Endorsement (Minimum Coverage)</h2>

  <p>
    This is the starter package insurers offer for very small businesses. It bumps up key limits.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Increases business property limit</li>
    <li>Adds basic liability protection</li>
    <li>Covers limited off-site work</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Good for freelancers, online sellers, and low-risk service providers.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Business Owners Policy (BOP) for Serious Home Businesses</h2>

  <p>
    If your home business has real revenue, inventory, or customer traffic, skip the endorsement and get a BOP instead.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Full business liability protection</li>
    <li>Higher equipment and inventory coverage</li>
    <li>Business interruption coverage</li>
    <li>Optional add-ons for cyber, errors & omissions, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A BOP turns your operation into a properly insured business—not a gamble.
  </p>

  <h2>5. When Your Business Requires Its Own Policy</h2>

  <p>
    Some businesses are too risky for a homeowners attachment or BOP.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Contractors</li>
    <li>Health or fitness professionals</li>
    <li>Manufacturing or fabrication</li>
    <li>Businesses handling sensitive data</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These require standalone liability or professional insurance.
  </p>

  <h2>6. What You Should Do Right Now</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Make a list of all business-related equipment and inventory</li>
    <li>Estimate replacement cost</li>
    <li>Review your homeowners exclusions</li>
    <li>Decide whether an endorsement or a BOP fits your risk</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Treat your home business like a real business—because your insurer definitely will when a claim hits.

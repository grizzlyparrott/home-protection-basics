  <h1>Documenting Your Home for Insurance</h1>

  <p>
    Most claim delays—and denials—aren’t about the damage. They’re about proof. If you can’t show what you owned, what condition it was in, and roughly what it was worth, the adjuster has all the leverage. Documentation fixes that. Done right, it turns a stressful claim into a clean transaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    You don’t need a spreadsheet that looks like an accountant built it. You just need a simple system you can update yearly. If you haven’t seen the <a href="home-inventory-checklist">home inventory checklist</a> yet, use it alongside this guide.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Start With a Full-Home Photo Sweep</h2>

  <p>
    Walk every room with your phone camera. Don’t overthink it—insurance needs clarity, not cinematography. Shoot walls, ceilings, floors, and anything built in. Then take slower, tighter shots of valuables and electronics.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Open drawers, cabinets, closets—adjusters expect interior shots.</li>
    <li>Photograph serial numbers and model labels.</li>
    <li>Capture unique wear or distinguishing features to prove ownership.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A photo sweep captures condition, which matters. After a fire or break-in, everything looks like debris. Your pictures show what it looked like before.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Record a Single Continuous Walkthrough Video</h2>

  <p>
    Video verifies context—layout, quantity, and location of items. A single continuous recording leaves no room for accusations of “staged inventory.” Insurance companies love video because it reduces disputes.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Walk slow enough so every item is identifiable.</li>
    <li>Speak out loud when showing high-value property (“Sony A7 camera, purchased 2023”).</li>
    <li>Show closets, garages, sheds, and the exterior.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you want to take this up a level, pair it with the guide on <a href="creating-a-home-inventory-video">creating a home inventory video</a> for a more structured approach.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Collect the Financial Proof: Receipts, Emails, and Screenshots</h2>

  <p>
    Insurance doesn’t require receipts for everything, but any high-value item is easier to claim when you have proof of purchase. Don’t stress if you don’t have receipts for older items—your photos and video usually cover that gap.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Screenshot order histories from Amazon, Home Depot, Lowe’s, and electronics stores.</li>
    <li>Keep PDFs of warranties or online purchase confirmations.</li>
    <li>Store scans or photos of paper receipts.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you lost proof of purchase entirely, the insurer still owes you for covered property—you just have to show it existed. This is where your documentation earns its keep.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Build a Simple Home Inventory</h2>

  <p>
    Your inventory doesn’t need exact dollar values. Categories and rough quantities are enough. The point is to give the adjuster a clear picture of what you owned so they don’t undervalue your claim.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>List major items: TV, bed, appliances, tools, instruments, etc.</li>
    <li>Group smaller items (“Kitchen utensils – approx. 40 pieces”).</li>
    <li>Flag valuables that need scheduling or endorsement.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you discover something that obviously needs separate coverage—jewelry, collectibles, firearms—review the <a href="personal-property-coverage-basics">personal property basics</a> guide.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Store Everything in Two Places</h2>

  <p>
    Documentation is useless if it burns with the house. Store backups in two locations: one digital, one physical (if possible).
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cloud storage: Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox.</li>
    <li>External drive stored off-site.</li>
    <li>Printed inventory stored in a fireproof safe.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The goal is simple: if disaster hits, you can pull up proof within minutes. That alone can shave weeks off a claim.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Update Once a Year—No Exceptions</h2>

  <p>
    A home inventory from five years ago won’t match your current life. Set a yearly reminder. Do a quick walkthrough. Add major purchases. Delete items you no longer own. Ten minutes of maintenance keeps your claim airtight.
  </p>

  <h1>Creating a Home Inventory Video</h1>

  <p>
    A home inventory video is one of the strongest forms of proof you can provide in an insurance claim. It shows your belongings, their condition, where they were stored, and the quantity—all in one continuous recording. Done right, it eliminates arguments about ownership, value, or whether the items even existed.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you need help building a written inventory to pair with your video, the <a href="home-inventory-checklist">home inventory checklist</a> walks through that process step-by-step.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Keep the Video Continuous</h2>

  <p>
    The biggest mistake homeowners make is filming in separate clips. Insurers prefer one continuous video because it prevents accusations of staging or editing.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>No cuts</li>
    <li>No jump edits</li>
    <li>No restarting halfway through a room</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you mess up, stop and start the entire room over.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Walk Room by Room, In a Logical Order</h2>

  <p>
    Start at your front door and move systematically through the house. Consistency helps adjusters understand where items were located.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Front entry → living room → kitchen → bedrooms → closets → garage</li>
    <li>Record exterior storage areas last</li>
    <li>Open every closet, drawer, and cabinet</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Don’t skip storage spaces—those are the areas homeowners forget most.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Narrate What You’re Recording</h2>

  <p>
    Talking during the video adds context and proves you understand what you’re showing.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>State what room you’re in</li>
    <li>Identify expensive or unique items</li>
    <li>Mention brands or model numbers when visible</li>
    <li>Point out serial numbers on electronics</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The goal is clarity: let the adjuster understand exactly what you’re showing.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Capture Items Individually and in Context</h2>

  <p>
    Insurers want to see items in their real environment—not isolated close-ups.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Wide shot of the entire room</li>
    <li>Medium shot of shelves, desks, or furniture</li>
    <li>Close-up on item labels, logos, or serial numbers</li>
    <li>Open drawers and cabinets to reveal contents</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This approach proves ownership and placement at the same time.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Don’t Forget the “Invisible” Value Items</h2>

  <p>
    Homeowners consistently forget:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Power tools</li>
    <li>Sports equipment</li>
    <li>Firearms or safes</li>
    <li>Outdoor gear</li>
    <li>Garden tools and machines</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These items add up fast and are often missing from written inventories.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Film Condition, Not Just Existence</h2>

  <p>
    Insurers sometimes reduce payouts by claiming an item was “old” or “already damaged.” Film condition clearly:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Screen quality on electronics</li>
    <li>Unstained or unscuffed furniture</li>
    <li>Working appliances</li>
    <li>Clean flooring and carpet condition</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Your goal is to remove doubt and prevent value disputes.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Back Up Your Video in Multiple Places</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)</li>
    <li>External hard drive</li>
    <li>A second family member or trusted person</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If your home burns down, your video shouldn’t burn with it.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Update Your Inventory Yearly</h2>

  <p>
    New purchases, sold items, and replaced belongings all change your inventory. Record a new video once a year or after major purchases.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Post-renovation</li>
    <li>After buying new furniture</li>
    <li>After holidays and major gift seasons</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The cleaner your documentation, the smoother your claim.

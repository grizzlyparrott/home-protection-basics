  <h1>Insurance Endorsements Basics</h1>

  <p>
    A standard homeowners policy looks complete on paper—but it has holes big enough to drive a truck through. Endorsements are the add-ons that plug those gaps. Some are essential. Some are optional. Some are pure fluff. This guide cuts out the garbage and shows you which endorsements actually prevent denied claims and out-of-pocket disasters.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you aren’t clear on what your base policy already covers, skim <a href="homeowners-insurance-coverage-explained">coverage explained</a> first. Endorsements only make sense once you understand the defaults.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Water Backup Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    The most important endorsement homeowners skip. Water backup covers damage from clogged drains, failed sump pumps, and sewer line reversals—none of which are covered in a standard policy.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Typical limits: $5,000–$25,000</li>
    <li>Protects basements, finished or not</li>
    <li>Covers cleanup—expensive if done professionally</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If water intrusion is your main worry, see <a href="sewer-backup-coverage-basics">water backup basics</a> for the full picture.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Extended Dwelling Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    Rebuild costs spike after disasters. Extended dwelling coverage (often +10% to +50%) prevents underinsurance when material and labor prices skyrocket.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Crucial after wildfires, hurricanes, or regional disasters</li>
    <li>Prevents you from paying rebuild cost overruns out of pocket</li>
    <li>Strong protection for older or custom homes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you don’t understand how insurers calculate limits, review <a href="understanding-policy-limits">policy limits</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Service Line Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    Homeowners are responsible for water, sewer, and electrical lines running underground from the house to the street. Standard policies do not cover breaks or collapses.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Typical coverage: $10,000–$20,000</li>
    <li>Fixes excavation, pipe replacement, and restoration</li>
    <li>Worth it for older homes with mature trees</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Equipment Breakdown Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    This covers mechanical or electrical failure of major home systems—something normal policies treat as maintenance.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>HVAC systems</li>
    <li>Water heaters</li>
    <li>Appliances</li>
    <li>Electrical panels and backup generators</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Cheap endorsement, strong value—especially for homes with aging systems.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Scheduled Personal Property</h2>

  <p>
    High-value items like jewelry, firearms, collectibles, and art have low sub-limits unless scheduled individually.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Covers items for full replacement value</li>
    <li>Often removes deductible</li>
    <li>Covers mysterious disappearance (not just theft)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you’ve never scheduled anything before, start with <a href="scheduling-high-value-items">scheduling valuables</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Ordinance or Law Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    When rebuilding after damage, your town may force upgrades to meet new building codes. Without this endorsement, you pay the difference yourself.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Required for older homes</li>
    <li>Can add thousands in unexpected costs</li>
    <li>Usually very cheap to add</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Foundation Water Coverage (Where Available)</h2>

  <p>
    Some regions offer endorsements for foundation leaks, seepage, or hydrostatic pressure—none of which are covered normally. If your basement walls look like they’re sweating, this is worth asking about.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Home-Based Business Endorsement</h2>

  <p>
    If you run anything from home—a side hustle, Etsy shop, tutoring—you likely need extra protection.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Boosts business property limits</li>
    <li>Adds limited liability coverage</li>
    <li>Protects equipment stored at home</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h2>9. Why Endorsements Matter More Than Discounts</h2>

  <p>
    Discounts reduce your bill a little. Endorsements prevent catastrophic out-of-pocket losses. One saves $30–$50 a year. The other saves $5,000–$50,000 during a disaster.
  </p>

  <h2>10. How to Identify Which Endorsements You Need</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Review your declarations page every renewal</li>
    <li>Check local risks—flood, sewer, wildfire, hail</li>
    <li>Evaluate your home's systems and age</li>
    <li>Consider your valuables and hobby equipment</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Endorsements aren’t add-ons—they’re risk patches. Build the policy backward from your vulnerabilities, not the insurer’s default template.

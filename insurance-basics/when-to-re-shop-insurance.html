<h1>When to Re-Shop Your Insurance</h1>

<p>
Home insurance isn’t a “set it and forget it” purchase. Rates change, risk models change, and insurers quietly adjust coverage behind the scenes. If you never re-shop your policy, you eventually end up overpaying or holding coverage that no longer matches your home. This guide explains the exact situations where re-shopping isn’t just smart—it’s necessary.
</p>

<p>
Before you shop around, make sure you understand your current coverage. If you need a quick refresher, review <a href="homeowners-insurance-coverage-explained">coverage explained</a> so you're comparing policies accurately.
</p>

<h2>1. After Any Major Rate Increase</h2>

<p>
If your premium jumps more than 10–15% in a single renewal without a claim, your insurer is adjusting risk—or pushing customers out.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Request a written explanation</li>
  <li>Compare the increase to market averages</li>
  <li>Get at least three competing quotes</li>
</ul>

<p>
You don’t owe loyalty to a company raising your rates for no reason.
</p>

<h2>2. After Completing Home Upgrades</h2>

<p>
Certain improvements reduce your risk and should lower your premium. Examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>New roof</li>
  <li>Upgraded electrical system</li>
  <li>New plumbing or HVAC</li>
  <li>Security system installation</li>
</ul>

<p>
If your insurer doesn’t adjust pricing after upgrades, re-shop. If you don’t know which upgrades matter most, see <a href="home-upgrades-that-affect-premiums">upgrades that affect premiums</a>.
</p>

<h2>3. After Filing a Claim</h2>

<p>
Some insurers punish claims harder than others. After a major claim:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check for rate hikes</li>
  <li>Review coverage reductions</li>
  <li>Look for new exclusions added quietly</li>
</ul>

<p>
If your policy becomes less competitive, get quotes from companies with stronger post-claim treatment.
</p>

<h2>4. When Your Roof Reaches the “Danger Zone”</h2>

<p>
Insurers downgrade coverage for older roofs, often switching from replacement cost to ACV without warning. If your roof crosses the 15–20 year mark, re-shop before renewals start turning ugly.
</p>

<p>
To understand why this matters, review <a href="roof-age-and-insurance-impact">roof age impact</a>.
</p>

<h2>5. When You Add High-Value Items to Your Home</h2>

<p>
If you buy jewelry, firearms, collectibles, camera equipment, or anything expensive, check if your insurer supports scheduling at a fair rate. Some do, some don’t.
</p>

<p>
If you don’t know how scheduling works, read <a href="scheduling-high-value-items">high-value item scheduling</a> first.
</p>

<h2>6. When Your Insurer Adds New Exclusions</h2>

<p>
Insurance companies constantly revise their policies. If your renewal includes new exclusions—especially roof, water, or cosmetic damage exclusions—consider leaving.
</p>

<p>
You can learn how to read exclusions effectively using <a href="understanding-insurance-exclusions">insurance exclusions</a>.
</p>

<h2>7. Every 2–3 Years Even Without a Trigger</h2>

<p>
Even if nothing major changes, it’s smart to re-shop occasionally:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rates shift based on regional losses</li>
  <li>New carriers enter your market</li>
  <li>Discounts change</li>
</ul>

<p>
Staying put for too long usually means you’re paying legacy rates that newer customers don’t.
</p>

<h2>8. Before Accepting Any Renewal With Coverage Downgrades</h2>

<p>
If your renewal includes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Higher deductibles</li>
  <li>ACV roof downgrade</li>
  <li>Reduced limits</li>
  <li>New water or wind exclusions</li>
</ul>

<p>
—all signs your insurer is exiting your region or trimming risk. Time to shop around.
</p>

<h2>9. How to Re-Shop Without Causing Coverage Gaps</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Never cancel your current policy until the new one is active</li>
  <li>Match dwelling, liability, and property limits exactly when comparing</li>
  <li>Confirm effective dates overlap by at least one day</li>
  <li>Verify coverage differences in endorsements</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you skipped your last renewal review, pair this with <a href="insurance-policy-review-basics">policy review basics</a> so you know what to check.
</p>

<h2>10. The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
Re-shopping your insurance isn’t about chasing the lowest price—it’s about catching silent downgrades, rate creep, and coverage gaps before they hit your wallet. Shop when rates jump, when your home changes, or when your insurer starts tightening coverage. A quick comparison can save hundreds and protect you from nasty surprises during a claim.

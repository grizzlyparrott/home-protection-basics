  <h1>Wind and Hail Coverage Basics</h1>

  <p>
    Wind and hail damage leads to more homeowner claims than almost any other peril—especially roof claims. But it’s also where insurers push back the hardest. Between strict roof age rules, percentage deductibles, and “wear and tear” rejections, homeowners get blindsided constantly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before diving into the specifics, review how roof and structural losses normally fall under <a href="dwelling-coverage-basics">dwelling coverage</a>. Wind and hail claims follow the same framework—with extra traps.
  </p>

  <h2>1. What Wind and Hail Damage Your Policy Typically Covers</h2>

  <p>
    Wind and hail are standard covered perils in HO-3 and HO-5 policies. If a storm causes sudden, accidental damage, coverage should apply.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Shingle loss, creasing, or uplift</li>
    <li>Hail impact to roofing, siding, windows, and gutters</li>
    <li>Tree damage caused by wind</li>
    <li>Water intrusion caused by storm-created openings</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The key is proving the damage was storm-caused—not wear, aging, or poor maintenance.
  </p>

  <h2>2. The “Wear and Tear” Denial: How Insurers Push Back</h2>

  <p>
    Roof claims get denied more than any other storm-related loss because insurers blame pre-existing wear instead of the storm. Adjusters look for:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Granule loss from age, not hail</li>
    <li>Brittle shingles</li>
    <li>Cracked or warped materials unrelated to the event</li>
    <li>Old patches or improper repairs</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you want the cleanest possible file, document your roof <em>before</em> storm season. See <a href="documenting-your-home-for-insurance">documenting your home</a> for a system to do it right.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Percentage Deductibles: The Storm Season Surprise</h2>

  <p>
    Many homeowners don’t realize their wind/hail deductible isn’t a flat dollar—it’s a percentage of the dwelling coverage. This dramatically changes your out-of-pocket cost.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>1%–5% is common</li>
    <li>$350,000 dwelling limit + 2% deductible = you pay $7,000</li>
    <li>Deductible applies even if the damage is minor</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This catches homeowners off guard every year. If you want to see how deductibles affect total payouts, review <a href="insurance-deductible-basics">deductibles</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Actual Cash Value Roof Endorsements (The Quiet Killer)</h2>

  <p>
    Some insurers quietly switch roofs to ACV-only coverage once they reach a certain age—often 10–15 years. This means your payout is based on depreciated value, not replacement cost.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Older roofs = heavy depreciation</li>
    <li>ACV payouts are often too small to replace the roof</li>
    <li>Repairs may not restore proper function</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If your declarations page lists “roof surfacing – ACV,” you need to read the guide on <a href="actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost">ACV vs replacement cost</a> immediately.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Hail Damage to Personal Property</h2>

  <p>
    Hail doesn’t just hit roofs. It destroys outdoor items too:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Patio furniture</li>
    <li>Outdoor equipment and tools</li>
    <li>Vehicles (handled under auto insurance)</li>
    <li>Windows and screens</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Personal property claims follow the same valuation rules as usual. If you're unsure how insurers calculate payouts, review <a href="personal-property-coverage-basics">personal property coverage</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>6. How to Strengthen a Wind or Hail Claim</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Take storm-day photos if possible</li>
    <li>Document shingles, gutters, and siding immediately</li>
    <li>Save weather reports or hail-size confirmations</li>
    <li>Get a contractor estimate in writing</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The more evidence you have, the harder it is for the insurer to blame age instead of the storm.
  </p>

  <h2>7. When to Reevaluate Your Wind/Hail Coverage</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>After roof replacement or upgrades</li>
    <li>If your deductible increases at renewal</li>
    <li>After buying a home with an older roof</li>
    <li>When replacing siding, windows, or exterior materials</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Storms are unavoidable. Getting blindsided by deductibles and ACV clauses is not.

  <h1>Homeowners Insurance Coverage Explained</h1>

  <p>
    A homeowners policy is built from several separate coverage buckets. Each protects a different part of your home or financial risk. If you know what each bucket does, you avoid surprises during a claim.
  </p>

  <p>
    This guide pairs well with 
    <a href="dwelling-coverage-basics.html">dwelling coverage basics</a>,
    <a href="personal-property-coverage-basics.html">personal property coverage basics</a>,
    and <a href="liability-coverage-basics.html">liability coverage basics</a> 
    if you want focused breakdowns of individual coverage parts.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Dwelling Coverage</h2>
  <p>
    This pays to repair or rebuild your home’s structure after a covered loss: fire, wind, certain types of water damage, vandalism, and similar named perils. It applies to the physical structure—roof, walls, floors, built-in fixtures, and attached structures.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Based on rebuild cost, not market price.</li>
    <li>Subject to your deductible.</li>
    <li>Coverage requires the damage be from a covered cause.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you’re unsure how your deductible affects payout amounts, see
    <a href="insurance-deductible-basics.html">insurance deductible basics</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Other Structures Coverage</h2>
  <p>
    Covers detached items: sheds, fences, detached garages, and certain permanent yard structures. Usually set at a percentage of the dwelling limit.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Personal Property Coverage</h2>
  <p>
    This replaces your belongings—furniture, electronics, clothing, tools—after a covered loss. Special limits apply to jewelry, firearms, collectibles, and cash.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a full breakdown of limits and replacement cost upgrades, read
    <a href="personal-property-coverage-basics.html">personal property coverage basics</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Liability Coverage</h2>
  <p>
    Liability protects you financially if you are held responsible for someone else’s injury or property damage. It does not cover your own injuries or your own property.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Slip-and-fall injuries on your property</li>
    <li>Dog bites</li>
    <li>Damage you accidentally cause to someone else’s property</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you’re unsure how much liability coverage to carry, see 
    <a href="liability-coverage-basics.html">liability coverage basics</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Loss of Use Coverage</h2>
  <p>
    Pays for temporary living costs (hotel, short-term rental, extra transport or food expenses) when a covered loss makes your home unlivable.
  </p>

  <p>
    More details are in 
    <a href="loss-of-use-coverage-basics.html">loss of use coverage basics</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>6. What Homeowners Insurance Usually Does Not Cover</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Floods — requires separate flood insurance.</li>
    <li>Earthquakes — usually requires a separate policy or endorsement.</li>
    <li>Wear and tear, rot, deterioration.</li>
    <li>Intentional damage.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For high-risk regions, review 
    <a href="flood-insurance-basics.html">flood insurance basics</a>
    and
    <a href="earthquake-insurance-basics.html">earthquake-insurance-basics.html</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Quick Annual Checkup</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Review dwelling limits if you remodeled or added square footage.</li>
    <li>Check personal property limits if you bought high-value items.</li>
    <li>Confirm liability limits are not set to the bare minimum.</li>
  </ul>

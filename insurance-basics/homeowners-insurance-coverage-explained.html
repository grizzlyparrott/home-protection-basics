  <h1>Homeowners Insurance Coverage Explained</h1>

  <p>
    A homeowners policy is a toolbox. Each coverage part has a job, and if you misunderstand even one of them, a claim can collapse fast. Most denials come from people assuming a loss was covered because it “felt like it should be.” This guide keeps you out of that trap.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want deeper breakdowns later, the guides on <a href="dwelling-coverage-basics">dwelling coverage</a> and <a href="personal-property-coverage-basics">personal property coverage</a> drill into the details—but for now, here’s the no-nonsense field map of what protects what.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Dwelling Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    This is the money that rebuilds your home after a covered loss. Fire, wind, sudden water discharge—if it’s listed as a covered peril, dwelling coverage steps in. If it’s not, nothing else in your policy will save you.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>It must be high enough to rebuild your home, not just “what you paid for it.”</li>
    <li>If you pick a sky-high deductible to save a little premium, you’ll regret it the first time a wall has to be opened up.</li>
    <li>Damage must be sudden and accidental—anything “maintenance-related” gets shut down immediately.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you don’t fully understand how your deductible changes real claim payouts, review <a href="insurance-deductible-basics">insurance deductibles</a> before you ever need to file.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Other Structures Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    This protects anything not physically attached to the home: fences, sheds, detached garages, standalone workshops. Most homeowners only notice this limit after a storm destroys something expensive—and by then it's too late to raise it.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Usually 10% of your dwelling limit by default.</li>
    <li>If you have a big shed or detached shop, you must increase it proactively.</li>
    <li>Flooding, ground movement, and rot are still excluded—even out here.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Personal Property Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    Everything you’d pack if you moved falls here. Furniture, electronics, clothes, tools—it’s all covered, but only up to the policy limit and only if the cause of loss is covered. Theft claims get scrutinized hard, especially without documentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Categories like jewelry and firearms have strict sublimits. If you haven’t read the guide on <a href="personal-property-coverage-basics">personal property basics</a>, do it before you assume your valuables are protected.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Liability Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    Liability protects your finances when someone else gets hurt or you damage their property. One lawsuit can blow through a low limit instantly, and raising this coverage is usually the cheapest upgrade in the entire policy.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Slip-and-fall injuries on your property</li>
    <li>Dog bites (the most frequent liability claim)</li>
    <li>Accidental property damage you cause elsewhere</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you don’t know what a “good” limit looks like, the <a href="liability-coverage-basics">liability basics</a> guide spells it out plainly.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Loss of Use Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    When a fire or major leak forces you out, this coverage pays for hotels, short-term housing, and increased day-to-day costs. It only kicks in for <strong>covered</strong> losses—if the cause wasn’t covered, you’re paying for your own displacement.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>It pays the extra cost above your normal living expenses.</li>
    <li>Some insurers cap it by time, others by dollar amount.</li>
    <li>Documentation matters—keep receipts or you’ll eat the cost.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. What Homeowners Insurance Won’t Cover</h2>

  <p>
    These exclusions are where most homeowners get blindsided:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Flooding from rising water — needs a separate flood policy.</li>
    <li>Earthquake, land movement, and settling — separate coverage required.</li>
    <li>Wear, tear, rot, and neglect — insurers deny these instantly.</li>
    <li>Damage from long-term leaks — considered maintenance failure.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you live anywhere with repeat natural hazards, pair this guide with the breakdowns on <a href="flood-insurance-basics">flood insurance</a> and <a href="earthquake-insurance-basics">earthquake insurance</a>. They plug coverage gaps most people don’t notice until after a disaster.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Quick Annual Checkup</h2>

  <p>
    A 10-minute review each year prevents nearly every underinsurance nightmare:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Raised the square footage or remodeled? Update your dwelling limit now.</li>
    <li>Bought high-value items? Schedule them or they’re not covered.</li>
    <li>Still carrying minimum liability? One bad accident can wipe you out.</li>
    <li>Don’t wait until renewal—changes apply immediately when you request them.</li>
  </ul>

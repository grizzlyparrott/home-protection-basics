  <h1>How Insurance Premiums Are Calculated</h1>

  <p>
    Insurance premiums aren’t random. They’re calculated using a risk formula that predicts how likely you are to file a claim—and how expensive that claim will be. Insurers do not care about fairness. They care about risk, cost, and whether your zip code loses them money.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to see how premiums interact with policy structure, review <a href="understanding-policy-limits">policy limits</a> before you start tweaking deductibles or coverage.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Rebuild Cost (Not Market Value)</h2>

  <p>
    The foundation of your premium is the cost to rebuild your home—not what you could sell it for. Market price is irrelevant. Construction cost is everything.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Square footage</li>
    <li>Construction type</li>
    <li>Roof material</li>
    <li>Foundation type</li>
    <li>Local labor rates</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If rebuild cost goes up, your premium goes up. This is why inflation protection raises coverage automatically.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Location Risk</h2>

  <p>
    Your address is one of the biggest premium drivers.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Wildfire zones</li>
    <li>Hail-prone regions</li>
    <li>Wind/hurricane areas</li>
    <li>Flood-prone neighborhoods</li>
    <li>Crime rate for theft and vandalism</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    High-risk zip codes pay more even if your house has never been damaged.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Roof Age and Condition</h2>

  <p>
    Your roof is the most expensive part of your home to insure. Old or brittle roofs raise premiums instantly—or trigger coverage restrictions.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>10–15 years old = higher premiums</li>
    <li>15–20 years old = ACV roof coverage likely</li>
    <li>20+ years old = insurer may refuse coverage entirely</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you see your roof downgraded to ACV, review <a href="actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost">ACV vs RCV</a> so you understand the hit to payouts.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Deductibles</h2>

  <p>
    Deductibles heavily influence premiums—especially percentage deductibles for wind and hail.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Higher deductible = lower premium</li>
    <li>Lower deductible = higher premium</li>
    <li>Percentage deductibles reduce premiums but increase risk</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you want to understand deductible math, review <a href="insurance-deductible-basics">deductibles</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Your Claim History</h2>

  <p>
    Every claim stays on your record for years—sometimes up to seven.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Water claims raise premiums the most</li>
    <li>Weather claims raise them moderately</li>
    <li>Theft claims raise them slightly</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Multiple claims can trigger non-renewal, even if none were your fault.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Liability Risk</h2>

  <p>
    Trampolines, pools, dogs with bite histories, and poor property maintenance all increase liability risk—and premiums.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>High-risk breeds may be excluded entirely</li>
    <li>Unfenced pools raise premiums sharply</li>
    <li>Poor lighting or unsafe walkways increase liability exposure</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Liability coverage is cheap—raise it. If you’re unsure where to set it, review <a href="liability-coverage-basics">liability coverage</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Fire Protection Score</h2>

  <p>
    Insurers score how well your area is protected from fire.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Distance to the nearest fire station</li>
    <li>Distance to the nearest fire hydrant</li>
    <li>Local water supply quality</li>
    <li>Fire department rating</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Poor scores mean higher premiums and fewer available insurers.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Credit-Based Insurance Score</h2>

  <p>
    In most states, insurers use a credit-based insurance score. This is not your credit score—but it’s closely related.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Late payments hurt your score</li>
    <li>High utilization hurts your score</li>
    <li>Long credit history helps</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Higher score = lower premium. It’s that simple.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Policy Structure and Endorsements</h2>

  <p>
    Every add-on or optional endorsement affects your premium.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Sewer backup coverage</li>
    <li>Equipment breakdown coverage</li>
    <li>Scheduled personal property</li>
    <li>Ordinance and law coverage</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Add-ons strengthen coverage—but they’re not free.
  </p>

  <h2>10. How to Lower Your Premium Without Weakening Coverage</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Increase your deductible (carefully)</li>
    <li>Improve your roof condition</li>
    <li>Add smoke detectors and security upgrades</li>
    <li>Bundle auto + home</li>
    <li>Shop around every few years</li>
    <li>Maintain a clean claim history</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Cutting coverage to save money always backfires. Optimize—not weaken.

  <h1>Insurance for Manufactured Homes</h1>

  <p>
    Manufactured homes can be fully insurable—but they’re judged differently than site-built homes. Insurers treat them as higher risk unless they meet specific standards: tie-downs, foundation type, roof condition, and build year all affect your rate and eligibility. This guide breaks down how insurers actually evaluate manufactured homes and what coverage gaps you need to close.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you aren’t familiar with how insurers evaluate property risk in general, skim <a href="how-insurers-evaluate-risk">how insurers evaluate risk</a>. Manufactured homes hit many of the same categories—but with stricter thresholds.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Why Manufactured Homes Are Rated Differently</h2>

  <p>
    Insurers price these homes higher because they historically suffer more damage from wind, water, and fire. Age and construction class also matter.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Homes built before 1976</strong> (pre-HUD code) are the hardest to insure</li>
    <li>Older homes may require inspections before binding the policy</li>
    <li>Roof age and material type heavily influence premiums</li>
    <li>Insurers want proof of anchoring or tie-down systems</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If your roof is older, review <a href="roof-age-and-insurance-impact">roof age impact</a>. Roof condition is one of the top rating factors for these homes.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Foundation Type Changes Everything</h2>

  <p>
    Insurers don’t like manufactured homes sitting on blocks alone. A home that isn’t properly anchored is a major wind-risk liability.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Permanent foundation</strong> = better rates and more insurers willing to write</li>
    <li><strong>Tie-downs or anchor systems</strong> required in many states</li>
    <li><strong>Skirting condition</strong> matters for freeze and pest protection</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If anchoring is missing or outdated, many insurers will bind the policy but require correction after inspection.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Roof Type and Condition Are Make-or-Break</h2>

  <p>
    Metal roofs are preferred because they withstand wind and resist leaks. Older shingle roofs are penalized heavily.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Rolled roofing → highest risk</li>
    <li>Asphalt shingles → acceptable if newer</li>
    <li>Metal roofs → best pricing and stability</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Manufactured homes get hit harder by ACV roof endorsements, so verify you still have replacement cost. If not, read <a href="actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost">ACV vs RCV</a> before accepting that downgrade.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Water Damage Risk Is Higher—and Insurers Know It</h2>

  <p>
    Plumbing lines routed through skirting, crawlspaces, or unheated areas freeze more often. Water claims are the #1 cause of cancellations.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Insulate plumbing properly</li>
    <li>Repair soft spots or sagging floors immediately</li>
    <li>Add water sensors in high-risk areas</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Consider adding <a href="sewer-backup-coverage-basics">water backup coverage</a> because sewer line issues hit manufactured homes more often.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Personal Property and Liability Work the Same as Any Home</h2>

  <p>
    These sections mirror normal homeowners insurance, but limits still need checking:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Make sure belongings are insured for replacement cost, not ACV</li>
    <li>Increase liability limits if you have dogs, pools, or frequent visitors</li>
    <li>Schedule valuables separately if needed</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    See <a href="personal-property-coverage-basics">personal property basics</a> if you need a refresher on how payouts work.
  </p>

  <h2>6. What Inspections Look For</h2>

  <p>
    Manufactured home inspections are stricter than site-built home inspections because the margin for structural issues is smaller.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Roof age, leaks, and missing shingles</li>
    <li>Tie-down condition and placement</li>
    <li>Skirting gaps, rot, or pest activity</li>
    <li>Signs of water intrusion or soft floors</li>
    <li>Electrical panel age and grounding</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you’ve never gone through an insurance inspection, read <a href="home-insurance-inspection-basics">inspection basics</a> to understand what triggers red flags.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Tips for Getting Better Rates</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Add or update anchor systems</li>
    <li>Upgrade to a metal roof when possible</li>
    <li>Replace outdated plumbing lines</li>
    <li>Improve skirting ventilation and insulation</li>
    <li>Document all improvements for underwriting</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. The Bottom Line</h2>

  <p>
    Manufactured homes can be insured affordably—but only when properly anchored, updated, and documented. The more you reduce wind, water, and structural risk, the more insurers trust your home (and the less they charge you for it).

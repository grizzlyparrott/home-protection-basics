  <h1>Discounts and Bundling Basics</h1>

  <p>
    Insurance companies sell discounts the same way grocery stores sell “deals”—most look good, but only a few actually move the needle. Bundling can save real money, but only under the right conditions. This guide cuts out the fluff and shows you what genuinely lowers your bill and what’s just marketing noise.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you don’t understand how your premium is calculated in the first place, review <a href="how-insurance-premiums-are-calculated">how premiums are calculated</a>. Discounts make more sense once you know what the insurer’s pricing model looks like.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Bundling: The Only Reliable Discount</h2>

  <p>
    Bundling home + auto (or home + another major policy) is the single biggest and most consistent discount you can get.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Typically saves 10–25%</li>
    <li>Applies to BOTH policies</li>
    <li>Often keeps rates steadier at renewal</li>
    <li>Improves customer retention (the real reason insurers offer it)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Bundling doesn’t always guarantee the lowest price, but it gives you leverage when comparing quotes.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Security and Safety Device Discounts</h2>

  <p>
    These discounts are small individually, but they stack well—especially if you already use smart-home devices.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Monitored alarms</li>
    <li>Smart smoke detectors</li>
    <li>Deadbolts and upgraded locks</li>
    <li>Video surveillance systems</li>
    <li>Fire sprinklers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you’re upgrading for insurance reasons, see <a href="home-security/wireless-vs-wired-security-systems">wireless vs wired systems</a> for actual hardware insight—not just insurer buzzwords.
  </p>

  <h2>3. New Home or Renovated Home Discounts</h2>

  <p>
    Insurers love newer homes because they fail less often. The same goes for homes with major recent upgrades.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>New roofs</li>
    <li>Updated plumbing or electrical</li>
    <li>Upgraded HVAC</li>
    <li>Foundation or structural improvements</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you recently renovated, pair this with <a href="home-upgrades-that-affect-premiums">home upgrades that affect premiums</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Claims-Free Discounts</h2>

  <p>
    These discounts reward homeowners who haven’t filed claims in several years. They’re typically 5–20% depending on the insurer.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>One claim usually removes the discount</li>
    <li>Two claims can remove even more discounts</li>
    <li>Water damage claims hit this the hardest</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you’re debating a small claim, read <a href="claims-vs-premium-impact">claims vs premium impact</a> first—you might regret filing it.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Loyalty Discounts</h2>

  <p>
    These exist, but they’re weak compared to others. Loyalty is worth maybe 2–5% unless paired with bundling.
  </p>

  <p>
    The real benefit is not savings—it’s better treatment at renewal because you’re less likely to switch carriers.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Credit-Based Discounts</h2>

  <p>
    Insurers use an insurance-specific credit score in most states. Better score = better pricing.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lower utilization helps</li>
    <li>Long credit history helps</li>
    <li>Avoiding late payments is crucial</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These aren’t labeled as “discounts,” but they act like one by lowering your base premium.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Multi-Policy and Specialty Discounts</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Home + umbrella</li>
    <li>Home + boat</li>
    <li>Home + RV or motorcycle</li>
    <li>Home + life insurance</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These vary but often bump savings another 5–10%.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Discounts That Don’t Matter Much</h2>

  <p>
    These look good on paper but usually only shave off a few dollars.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Paperless billing</li>
    <li>Automatic payments</li>
    <li>“Green home” checkboxes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    They’re fine—but they won’t move your bill in any meaningful way.
  </p>

  <h2>9. The Discount Trap: Sacrificing Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    The worst mistake homeowners make is chasing a lower premium by weakening the policy.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Raising deductibles too high</li>
    <li>Accepting ACV coverage on roofs</li>
    <li>Removing water backup coverage</li>
    <li>Dropping liability limits</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Discounts should never weaken your protection. You want the best price for proper coverage—not the worst coverage at a cheap price.

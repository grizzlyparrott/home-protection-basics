  <h1>Insurance for Rental Properties</h1>

  <p>
    The biggest mistake new landlords make is thinking their homeowners policy still applies once they rent out the property. It doesn’t. The moment a tenant signs a lease, your risk profile changes, and your homeowners policy becomes almost useless. You need a landlord policy (also called a DP-3) or you’re exposed to major losses—and denied claims.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want a refresher on how a standard homeowners policy behaves, review <a href="homeowners-insurance-coverage-explained">homeowners coverage</a> so you can see exactly what changes when tenants enter the picture.
  </p>

  <h2>1. What a Landlord Policy Actually Covers</h2>

  <p>
    A DP-3 policy covers the building itself, your liability as a landlord, and—most importantly—lost rental income when the home becomes uninhabitable after a covered loss.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fire, smoke, and explosion damage</li>
    <li>Wind, hail, and storm-related damage</li>
    <li>Water damage from sudden leaks (not slow leaks)</li>
    <li>Liability protection for injuries caused by property conditions</li>
    <li>Loss of rental income</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Most DP-3 policies use replacement cost for the structure, but personal property (yours) may default to ACV. If valuation matters to you, review <a href="actual-cash-value-vs-replacement-cost">ACV vs replacement cost</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What a Landlord Policy Does NOT Cover</h2>

  <p>
    Tenant-related damage is heavily restricted. This is where landlords get blindsided:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Normal wear and tear</strong> (never covered)</li>
    <li><strong>Intentional tenant damage</strong> (usually excluded)</li>
    <li><strong>Pet damage</strong> unless specifically endorsed</li>
    <li><strong>Maintenance failures</strong> (roof leaks, rot, neglect)</li>
    <li><strong>Tenant’s belongings</strong> (they need renters insurance)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Many new landlords find out the hard way that “tenant destroyed the carpet” isn’t an insurance claim—it’s a deposit issue.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Loss of Rental Income: The Most Critical Coverage</h2>

  <p>
    This is the part that saves landlords from major financial hits. If a fire, storm, or covered water loss forces your tenant out, the insurer pays you the lost rent until repairs finish.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Typically paid monthly</li>
    <li>Triggers only when the home is uninhabitable</li>
    <li>Does not apply to tenant nonpayment</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This functions similarly to ALE, but reversed. If you want to compare, read <a href="loss-of-use-coverage-basics">loss of use coverage</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Liability Risks Are Higher for Landlords</h2>

  <p>
    As a landlord, you’re responsible for providing a safe property. If a tenant or guest gets injured because of a hazard, your liability coverage steps in.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Slip-and-fall injuries</li>
    <li>Structural hazards (stairs, railings, flooring)</li>
    <li>Electrical or plumbing failures</li>
    <li>Carbon monoxide or smoke alarm failures</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Liability limits on landlord policies should be higher than the defaults. If you’re unsure where to set them, the <a href="liability-coverage-basics">liability coverage</a> guide explains realistic limits.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Optional Coverages That Landlords Should Strongly Consider</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vandalism coverage:</strong> Often excluded unless added.</li>
    <li><strong>Malicious tenant damage:</strong> Separate and not automatic.</li>
    <li><strong>Ordinance and law upgrades:</strong> Pays to meet updated building codes.</li>
    <li><strong>Plumbing/sewer backup:</strong> A common rental property nightmare.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These add-ons plug the biggest holes in basic DP-3 policies.
  </p>

  <h2>6. When Homeowners Policies Flat-Out Deny Claims</h2>

  <p>
    If you rent your property without switching to a landlord policy, insurers treat it as a material change in risk. That means:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The insurer can deny the claim entirely</li>
    <li>They can retroactively cancel the policy</li>
    <li>They can refund premiums instead of paying out</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Renting without the correct policy is one of the fastest ways to void coverage.
  </p>

  <h2>7. When to Update Your Landlord Policy</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>After renovations or major upgrades</li>
    <li>If you add furnished items you want covered</li>
    <li>When your rental income increases</li>
    <li>After tenant turnover or new leasing terms</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The goal is simple: protect the structure, protect the income stream, and protect yourself from liability. A standard homeowners policy does none of those once tenants get involved.

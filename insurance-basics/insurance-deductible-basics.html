  <h1>Insurance Deductible Basics</h1>

  <p>
    Homeowners misunderstand deductibles more than any other part of their policy. A deductible isn’t a “fee” or a number that gets subtracted somewhere quietly—it directly changes your payout. Pick it wrong and you’ll either overpay every year or get hit with a massive out-of-pocket bill when something goes wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're trying to understand how deductibles interact with other limits, pair this with the guide on <a href="understanding-policy-limits">policy limits</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>1. What a Deductible Actually Is</h2>

  <p>
    A deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket before insurance pays anything. If the repair costs don’t exceed your deductible, the insurer pays zero. There’s no partial payout, no negotiation, no exceptions.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Deductible applies per claim</li>
    <li>You pay it first—insurance covers the rest</li>
    <li>If damage is less than the deductible, the claim is pointless</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is why small cosmetic damage rarely leads to a payout—it simply doesn’t clear the deductible threshold.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Flat Deductibles vs. Percentage Wind/Hail Deductibles</h2>

  <p>
    Most policies use a flat dollar deductible—$500, $1,000, $2,500, etc. But wind/hail deductibles are often percentage-based, and homeowners don’t realize it until after a storm hits.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Flat deductible:</strong> predictable, same amount every claim</li>
    <li><strong>Percentage deductible:</strong> based on dwelling limit, not damage amount</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If your dwelling limit is $300,000 and you have a 2% wind/hail deductible, you’re paying $6,000 before insurance owes a penny. This catches homeowners off guard every storm season.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How Deductibles Affect Real Claim Payouts</h2>

  <p>
    The insurer doesn’t “subtract” the deductible from the repair cost—they subtract it from <strong>your payout</strong>. That’s why picking a deductible you can’t comfortably afford is a guaranteed problem.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>$8,000 roof damage, $2,500 deductible → insurer pays $5,500</li>
    <li>$1,400 water damage, $2,500 deductible → insurer pays $0</li>
    <li>$22,000 kitchen fire, $1,000 deductible → insurer pays $21,000</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you're unsure how this works with structural claims, review the breakdown on <a href="dwelling-coverage-basics">dwelling coverage</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4. The Deductible Mistakes Homeowners Always Make</h2>

  <p>
    Deductible regret is one of the most common issues homeowners complain about after a loss. These are the three traps:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Choosing the cheapest premium instead of the right deductible.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Picking a deductible higher than their savings.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring percentage deductibles buried in the policy.</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Insurers expect you to pick a deductible you can handle. If you choose one you can’t pay, the claim stalls—because they don’t waive it.
  </p>

  <h2>5. When You Should Raise or Lower Your Deductible</h2>

  <p>
    There’s no universal “best deductible”—it depends on your cash buffer and your risk tolerance.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Raise it:</strong> when you have solid savings and want a lower premium.</li>
    <li><strong>Lower it:</strong> when you can’t comfortably pay the current one during an emergency.</li>
    <li><strong>Review annually:</strong> life changes, so your deductible should too.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Most homeowners would be safer picking a deductible they can pay immediately without a credit card. That’s the real test.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Why Documentation Still Matters</h2>

  <p>
    Even with the right deductible, poorly documented losses slow claims down. Insurers want proof of damage, repair estimates, and clear photos—or they hesitate.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Photograph damage before cleanup</li>
    <li>Get written estimates</li>
    <li>Save contractor invoices</li>
  </ul>

    If you don’t have a documentation system yet, the guide on <a href="documenting-your-home-for-insurance">documenting your home</a> walks you through a clean process.

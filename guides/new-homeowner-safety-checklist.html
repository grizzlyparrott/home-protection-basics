<h1>New Homeowner Safety Checklist</h1>

<p>
  Closing day is done, the keys are in your hand, and now you need to make sure this place is actually safe to live in.
  Use this checklist during your first few days in the home to lock down entry points, verify alarms, and catch basic
  hazards before they turn into problems.
</p>

<p>
  If you want help choosing or upgrading a system while you work through this list, see
  <a href="/home-security/home-security-systems-explained.html">Home Security Systems Explained</a>. For stocking your
  first emergency supplies, pair this with the
  <a href="/emergency-prep/basic-home-emergency-kit-list.html">Basic Home Emergency Kit List</a> and
  <a href="/emergency-prep/home-hazard-identification.html">Home Hazard Identification</a>.
</p>

<h2>How to Use This Checklist</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Walk the home with a notepad or phone notes and this checklist open.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Mark items as <em>Done</em>, <em>Needs repair</em>, or <em>Needs buying</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Handle anything involving life safety (gas, electrical burning smell, no smoke alarms) first.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Group the rest into “this weekend” tasks and “next 30 days” tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1. Keys, Locks, and Entry Points</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Re-key or replace all exterior door locks (front, back, side, garage-to-house).</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Confirm every exterior door has a deadbolt that fully extends into the frame.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Check strike plates on exterior doors; upgrade to 3-inch screws into the framing if needed.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Test every exterior door for solid closing and latching without lifting or forcing.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Walk all ground-floor windows; verify they close fully and latches work.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Add window locks or pins to any sliding or loose windows that do not secure well.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Check basement and side-entry doors for gaps, rot, or weak frames.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Make a clear list of who has keys now (you, partner, trusted neighbor) and how many spares exist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Security Basics in the First 24 Hours</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Confirm exterior house numbers are visible from the street, day and night.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Replace burned-out porch and driveway bulbs so entry areas are lit at night.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Check existing cameras or doorbells to see if they work and are actually recording.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Change passwords and logins on any inherited smart locks, cameras, or Wi-Fi routers.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Walk the fence line and gates; verify they close and latch as intended.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Identify any easy climb points to second-story windows (lattice, sheds, low roofs).</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Choose one trusted neighbor and share a phone number for emergencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Fire, Smoke, and Carbon Monoxide Protection</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Locate every smoke alarm in the home (each bedroom, hallways, each level).</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Test all smoke alarms with the test button and replace batteries where needed.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Replace any smoke alarm older than 10 years (check the manufacture date on the back).</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Confirm there is at least one CO alarm on each level with fuel-burning appliances or an attached garage.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Test CO alarms and replace units older than 7–10 years, per manufacturer guidance.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Verify clear paths from bedrooms to exits; remove boxes blocking doors or hallways.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Choose two escape routes from each bedroom (door plus window if possible).</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Pick a safe meeting spot outside (tree, mailbox, light pole) for fire evacuations.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Confirm at least one fire extinguisher is accessible on each level, especially near the kitchen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Electrical, Gas, and Utilities</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Find the main electrical panel and label major breakers if they are not already labeled.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Identify the main water shutoff valve and make sure it turns freely.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Locate the gas shutoff (if applicable) and know when and how to shut it off safely.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Check for warm outlets, scorch marks, or a constant burning smell near electrical panels or outlets.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Test GFCI outlets in kitchens, bathrooms, garages, and exterior locations.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Note any extension cord “permanent fixes” and plan proper outlets or wiring instead.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Verify dryer venting is metal ducting, not crushed or clogged flexible hose.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Hazard Scan Inside the Home</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Walk every room and hallway looking for loose rugs, cords across walking paths, or unstable furniture.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Secure tall bookcases and TVs to the wall, especially in homes with kids or older adults.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Check stairways for solid handrails, adequate lighting, and non-slippery steps.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Inspect bathrooms for grab points, non-slip mats, and safe water temperature at taps.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Check for signs of past water leaks under sinks, around toilets, and at the water heater.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Note rooms with no working outlets or lights; they may hide electrical issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Outside and Yard Safety</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Walk the perimeter of the house and look for damaged siding, loose steps, or trip hazards.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Check walkways and driveways at night to see where additional lighting is needed.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Trim shrubs back from windows and doors where someone could hide.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Confirm gates close and latch; plan repairs to broken sections of fencing.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Inspect decks, balconies, and railings for rot, wobble, or loose fasteners.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Note any low-hanging power lines or tree limbs contacting the roof and schedule proper work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Documents, Photos, and Insurance</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Take clear photos or video of every room and major item for your home inventory.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Store digital copies of purchase records, closing documents, and major appliance manuals.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Place insurance policies, IDs, and critical documents in a fire-resistant, water-resistant container.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Verify your homeowners or renters policy is active on the correct address and move-in date.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Confirm coverage details for personal property, liability, and any special risks (flood, earthquake).</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Emergency Basics for the New House</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Choose an out-of-area emergency contact everyone in the household can call.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Post emergency numbers and home address on the fridge or by the main phone area.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Assemble a basic home emergency kit if you do not already have one.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Decide where flashlights, batteries, and backup lighting will be stored.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Make a plan for who grabs pets, meds, and go-bags if you have to leave quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. First Week and First Month Follow-Up</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Schedule any licensed trades needed (electrician, plumber, HVAC, locksmith) for critical issues found.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Prioritize low-cost, high-impact fixes: bulbs, locks, detectors, basic hardware.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Set reminders for monthly alarm tests and seasonal safety checks.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Re-walk the home at night once you are settled to spot anything you missed on day one.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You do not have to fix everything in the first weekend. The goal is to find the real risks early, handle life-safety
  problems immediately, and then chip away at the rest with a clear plan.

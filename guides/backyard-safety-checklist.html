<h1>Backyard Safety Checklist</h1>

<p>
  Backyards look harmless until someone trips on a broken step, falls through a loose railing, or a kid wanders through an open gate. 
  This checklist walks the yard the way an insurance adjuster or ER nurse would—looking for the stuff that actually sends people to the hospital.
</p>

  <a href="summer-fire-risk-checklist.html">Summer Fire Risk Checklist</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. Fences, Gates, and Property Boundaries</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Walk the full fence line and look for gaps, rot, missing panels, or leaning sections.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Verify every gate fully latches and self-closes if it protects a pool or drop-off.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Fix or block any “shortcut” holes where pets or kids can slip under or through.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Make sure house numbers are visible from the alley or rear access if responders might come from that side.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Walking Surfaces and Trip Hazards</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Inspect patios, pavers, and walkways for lifted edges, cracks, or loose stones.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Mark or grind down any abrupt height changes over 1/2 inch that can catch a toe.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Clear extension cords, hoses, and garden tools off main paths.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Confirm steps and transitions are obvious, not hidden by rugs, leaves, or clutter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Decks, Stairs, and Railings</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Push against deck railings and guardrails—if they flex or wobble, fix them.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Check for rotted boards, loose nails, or screws sticking up on decks and stairs.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Verify stair handrails are solid and continuous where there are multiple steps.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Add non-slip strips or paint to slick wood or composite steps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Grills, Fire Pits, and Heat Sources</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Move grills and smokers at least 10 feet away from the house, siding, and railings.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Check gas hoses for cracks, leaks, or loose connections before lighting.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Keep fire pits off wooden decks unless they’re rated and properly shielded.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Store charcoal, lighter fluid, and propane away from kids and ignition sources.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Pools, Hot Tubs, and Water Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Confirm pool fences, gates, and latches meet local code and actually work every time.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Remove climbable objects (chairs, planters, toys) from near pool fencing.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Cover hot tubs with a locking cover when not in use.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Drain or fence off decorative ponds or large buckets that can be a drowning hazard for small children.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Play Areas and Kid Hazards</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Inspect swings, slides, and playsets for rust, loose bolts, and sharp edges.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Make sure there’s impact-absorbing material (mulch, rubber, sand) under play equipment, not bare concrete.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Remove ropes, cords, and hanging straps that can tangle around necks or limbs.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Set clear boundaries where kids are and are not allowed—especially near sheds, tools, and driveways.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Tools, Equipment, and Chemicals</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Lock up lawn tools, trimmers, saws, and power equipment when not in use.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Store gasoline, pesticides, and fertilizers in labeled, closed containers out of kids’ reach.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Coil and hang garden hoses instead of leaving them across paths.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Unplug and safely store electric yard tools once you’re done—no live cords sitting in wet grass.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Lighting and Visibility</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Test all exterior lights, especially along paths, steps, and doorways.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Add motion-activated lighting to dark corners, side yards, and gates.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Trim vegetation blocking lights or creating hiding spots near doors and windows.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Make sure switches or smart controls are obvious so guests aren’t walking blind.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Trees, Shrubs, and Yard Debris</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Cut back dead branches that can fall on people, roofs, or power lines.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Trim shrubs away from walkways to avoid scratches and blocked sightlines.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Rake up loose branches, toys, and junk that become projectiles in high wind.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Clear dry brush and leaves away from the house, deck, and fence to reduce fire risk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>10. Weather, Parties, and Regular Use</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Identify where water pools after rain and fix low spots that turn into mud or ice traps.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Check umbrellas, canopies, and shade sails for secure anchoring before storms.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Plan where guests will walk, sit, and cook during gatherings—fix hazards on those routes first.</li>
  <li><strong>[ ]</strong> Run this checklist before each season change or major event, along with your 
    <a href="weekend-security-upgrade-list.html">Weekend Security Upgrade List</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  A safe backyard isn’t about making everything pretty—it’s about removing the handful of problems that actually send people to urgent care. 
  Walk the yard with this list once, fix what you find, and repeat before big parties or each new season.

<h1>Medication Management During Emergencies: Staying Safe When Access Drops</h1>

<p>
  When disasters hit, pharmacies close, delivery services halt, and refill schedules stop mattering. People who rely on
  daily medications get hit hardest—not because they didn’t prepare, but because the system around them disappears for
  days or weeks. This guide shows how to manage prescriptions, backups, and medical equipment so you aren’t vulnerable
  when everything shuts down.
</p>

<p>
  If you’re preparing this as part of a larger home kit, read the 
  <a href="home-first-aid-kit-basics.html">Home First Aid Kit Basics</a> guide to build the medical side of your supplies.
</p>

<h2>1. Know Exactly What You Take and When</h2>

<p>
  The first step is boring but critical: document everything. List:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your current medications and dosages</li>
  <li>When and how often you take each one</li>
  <li>Your prescribing providers and pharmacy info</li>
  <li>Allergies and major medical conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Keep this list printed and stored with your go-bag. In emergencies, paper beats phone batteries.
</p>

<h2>2. Maintain a Reasonable Backup Supply</h2>

<p>
  Many medications allow early refills or “refill synchronization” that gradually builds a cushion without breaking any
  rules. Ask your provider or pharmacist about:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>90-day supply options</li>
  <li>Early refill allowances before travel or severe weather</li>
  <li>Automatic refill programs</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Your goal is simple: never let your home supply drop to the last few pills.
</p>

<h2>3. Store Medications the Right Way</h2>

<p>
  Heat, humidity, and sunlight destroy medications faster than people think. Keep them:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>In original containers</li>
  <li>In a cool, dry location away from windows</li>
  <li>Inside a waterproof pouch if they’re part of your go-bag</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you’re in a hot or humid climate, consider storing extras in a temperature-stable closet instead of a bathroom.
</p>

<h2>4. Managing Medication During Power Outages</h2>

<p>
  Some medications require refrigeration—insulin is the most common. During outages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use insulated lunch boxes or small coolers with ice packs</li>
  <li>Avoid freezing the medication (just keep it cool)</li>
  <li>Open the fridge as little as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For longer outages, combine this with your broader  
  <a href="power-outage-prep-basics.html">Power Outage Prep Basics</a> strategy so you’re not improvising.
</p>

<h2>5. Make a Plan for Medical Devices</h2>

<p>
  CPAP machines, oxygen concentrators, nebulizers, and other devices complicate emergencies. You need:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Backup batteries if your device supports them</li>
  <li>Manual alternatives (for nebulizers, talk to your provider)</li>
  <li>Extension cords and surge protection if you relocate to a shelter</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If power-dependence is serious for you or someone in the home, reconsider your evacuation plan so you don’t end up
  stuck somewhere unsafe.
</p>

<h2>6. Traveling or Evacuating With Medications</h2>

<p>
  Whether you’re evacuating for a hurricane or leaving due to a chemical spill, the rules are the same:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pack at least a week of medications</li>
  <li>Keep them in your go-bag, not in a suitcase</li>
  <li>Bring a printed medication list</li>
  <li>Carry a small pill organizer for day-to-day use</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For evacuation-specific guidance, see  
  <a href="short-term-evacuation-prep.html">Short-Term Evacuation Prep</a>.
</p>

<h2>7. Know Your Pharmacy Backup Options</h2>

<p>
  Not all pharmacies fail at the same time. Sometimes one chain is down while another is open. Learn:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The closest 24-hour pharmacy</li>
  <li>An alternate chain or independent pharmacy nearby</li>
  <li>Which pharmacies your insurance supports out-of-network</li>
</ul>

<p>
  When disaster hits, calling around matters more than loyalty points.
</p>

<h2>8. Dispose of Medications Safely</h2>

<p>
  When medications expire or get contaminated, don’t throw them in the trash or flush them. Use:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pharmacy take-back programs</li>
  <li>County hazardous waste disposal</li>
  <li>Law enforcement drop boxes</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Safe disposal prevents accidents and environmental harm.
</p>

<h2>9. The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  Medication management during emergencies is simple: track what you take, build a buffer, store it right, and have a
  plan for outages and evacuation. Your health shouldn’t fall apart just because the power grid or pharmacy network does.

        <h2>Emergency Prep Basics</h2>
        <p>
          Most “disaster prep” advice is written for people who want bunkers. This is not that. This is realistic prep for the stuff that
          actually happens: power outages, storms, short-term evacuations, and losing access to basic services for a few days.
        </p>
        <p>
          This section covers home emergency kits, water and food basics, power outage prep, and how to protect important documents so a flood,
          fire, or storm does not turn into a paperwork nightmare.

<h1>Power Bank and Generator Basics: Keeping Electricity When the Grid Fails</h1>

<p>
  When the grid goes down, the two biggest problems are simple: no way to communicate and no way to keep essential devices
  running. Power banks cover the small stuff; generators cover the big stuff. This guide explains what each one does,
  what to buy, and the safety rules that prevent carbon monoxide deaths—because that’s the mistake people make every year.
</p>

  <a href="power-outage-prep-basics.html">Power Outage Prep Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. What Power Banks Are Actually Good For</h2>

<p>
  Power banks keep your small electronics alive when everything else shuts off. They are ideal for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phones</li>
  <li>Radios</li>
  <li>Flashlights and headlamps</li>
  <li>Small USB-powered devices</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Buy banks with at least 10,000–20,000mAh. Anything less won’t last a real outage.
</p>

<h2>2. Choosing the Right Size Power Bank</h2>

<p>
  Simple rule:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>10,000mAh:</strong> 1–2 phone charges</li>
  <li><strong>20,000mAh:</strong> 3–5 charges</li>
  <li><strong>30,000mAh+:</strong> Several charges and small device support</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Avoid cheap no-name brands. They fail fast or inflate their capacity numbers.
</p>

<h2>3. Solar Panels: Good Supplement, Bad Primary Source</h2>

<p>
  Small solar panels work, but slowly. Treat them as a backup:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good for topping off power banks during long outages</li>
  <li>Useless during storms or cloudy days</li>
  <li>Too slow to charge high-capacity banks quickly</li>
</ul>

<p>
  They're nice to have—but never rely on them alone.
</p>

<h2>4. Generator Basics</h2>

<p>
  Generators power the larger stuff power banks can’t touch:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Refrigerators</li>
  <li>Medical devices</li>
  <li>Fans and limited AC units</li>
  <li>Lights and tools</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You don’t need a giant whole-home generator. Most people do fine with a 2,000–4,000-watt portable unit.
</p>

<h2>5. The One Rule People Break: Never Use a Generator Indoors</h2>

<p>
  Generators produce deadly carbon monoxide. This is non-negotiable:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Never inside the house</li>
  <li>Never inside the garage</li>
  <li>Never in a shed or covered patio</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Run them outdoors, away from windows and doors. Every year, families die because someone tried to hide a generator from the rain.
</p>

<p>

  <a href="/fire-safety/carbon-monoxide-safety-basics.html">Carbon Monoxide Safety Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>6. Storing Fuel the Right Way</h2>

<p>
  Gasoline goes bad and becomes dangerous when stored incorrectly. Follow:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use approved fuel containers</li>
  <li>Label every can</li>
  <li>Store away from heat sources</li>
  <li>Rotate fuel every few months</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Full fuel rules are in  
  <a href="fuel-storage-safety-basics.html">Fuel Storage Safety Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>7. Quiet vs. Conventional Generators</h2>

<p>
  Inverter generators (“quiet generators”) are more expensive but far better for neighborhoods and fuel efficiency:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quieter, so neighbors don’t hate you</li>
  <li>Safer for electronics</li>
  <li>Use less fuel during long outages</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Conventional generators work fine—they’re just louder and rougher on sensitive electronics.
</p>

<h2>8. Maintenance You Can’t Ignore</h2>

<p>
  Generators fail when people don’t run them for months. Basic upkeep:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start it once a month</li>
  <li>Keep fresh fuel</li>
  <li>Check oil and air filters</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you wait until the storm hits to test it, it’s already too late.
</p>

<h2>9. The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  Power banks cover communication. Generators cover survival-level electricity. Together, they turn outages from a crisis
  into an inconvenience. Get hardware that matches your needs, store fuel safely, and follow the CO rules every single time.

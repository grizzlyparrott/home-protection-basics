<h1>Bug-In vs. Bug-Out Basics: How to Choose the Safer Option</h1>

<p>
  The decision to stay home (bug in) or leave (bug out) is one of the most important calls you’ll ever make during an
  emergency. People make bad choices because they wait too long, assume conditions will improve, or underestimate how
  fast situations can turn. This guide gives you a simple, logical way to make that call.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to build a full communication plan around this decision, see 
  <a href="family-communication-plan-basics.html">Family Communication Plan Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. What “Bugging In” Really Means</h2>

<p>
  Bugging in means staying home, using your existing supplies, and riding out the event where you are. This works best
  for events where:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your home is structurally safe</li>
  <li>Utilities are disrupted but not dangerous</li>
  <li>Roads are blocked or unsafe for travel</li>
  <li>The threat is temporary or slow-moving</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Common bug-in situations include winter storms, power outages, shelter-in-place orders, and moderate flooding.
</p>

<h2>2. What “Bugging Out” Really Means</h2>

<p>
  Bugging out means leaving before it becomes impossible. It requires a destination, a route, and a clear decision point.
</p>

<p>
  Evacuation is the correct move when:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The home is unsafe or uninhabitable</li>
  <li>A fast-moving threat is approaching (wildfire, chemical spill)</li>
  <li>Authorities issue mandatory evacuation orders</li>
  <li>You’ll lose access to medical needs if you stay</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For identifying safe routes ahead of time, review 
  <a href="evacuation-route-planning.html">Evacuation Route Planning</a>.
</p>

<h2>3. The Three-Part Decision Framework</h2>

<p>
  Use these three questions to decide quickly and clearly:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Is the home safe?</strong> (Structure, utilities, hazards)</li>
  <li><strong>Is the threat getting worse?</strong> (Speed, direction, forecast)</li>
  <li><strong>Are travel routes still open?</strong> (Road closures, smoke, flooding)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If any one of these becomes a firm “no,” it’s time to leave.
</p>

<h2>4. Trigger Points: Decide Before the Danger Peaks</h2>

<p>
  Most people wait too long because they want more information. By the time they realize they should leave, everyone else
  is leaving too—roads clog and visibility drops.
</p>

<p>
  Set clear triggers such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fire is within one mile</li>
  <li>River reaches a specific flood stage</li>
  <li>Authorities issue a voluntary evacuation</li>
  <li>Power is out and temperatures are extreme</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If the trigger hits, you don’t negotiate with yourself. You leave.
</p>

<h2>5. When Bugging In Is the Smarter Move</h2>

<p>
  Sheltering at home is usually safer when:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Threats are slow-moving (snow, heat, minor storms)</li>
  <li>You have a stocked emergency kit</li>
  <li>Your home isn’t in a direct hazard zone</li>
  <li>Leaving puts you into the threat instead of away from it</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you haven’t built your home kit yet, check the 
  <a href="basic-home-emergency-kit-list.html">Basic Home Emergency Kit List</a>.
</p>

<h2>6. When Bugging Out Is the Only Good Option</h2>

<p>
  Evacuate immediately if:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>You smell gas or see structural damage</li>
  <li>Wildfire embers are landing in your yard</li>
  <li>Floodwater is rising rapidly</li>
  <li>A chemical spill is spreading</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For chemical-specific guidance, read 
  <a href="chemical-spill-preparedness.html">Chemical Spill Preparedness</a>.
</p>

<h2>7. Preparing Both Options Ahead of Time</h2>

<p>
  A real emergency doesn’t give you time to plan from scratch. Your home should have:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A stocked 72-hour kit</li>
  <li>A go-bag for fast evacuation</li>
  <li>Printed contact lists</li>
  <li>A pre-planned meeting point</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. The Honest Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  There isn’t a perfect answer every time. But if you follow the framework—home safety, threat movement, travel conditions—
  you’ll avoid the biggest mistakes: waiting too long, leaving too late, or staying when the house can’t protect you.

<h1>Emergency Cash Storage Basics: Keeping Money Accessible and Safe</h1>

<p>
  When power outages, bank failures, or evacuations hit, digital payments go down first. Cash becomes the only way to buy 
  food, gas, or lodging. Storing emergency cash isn’t paranoid—it’s practical. But you have to do it right or the money 
  becomes useless, damaged, or easy for a thief to find.
</p>

<p>
  For a full list of what to pack for evacuations, see 
  <a href="evacuation-loading-priorities.html">Evacuation Loading Priorities</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. How Much Emergency Cash to Keep</h2>

<p>
  The right amount depends on your situation, but a simple rule works for most homeowners:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>$100–$300</strong> for basic disruptions</li>
  <li><strong>$300–$700</strong> for short-notice evacuations</li>
  <li><strong>$1,000+</strong> if you want a full “get out now” fund</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Keep a mix of bills—small bills prevent overpaying when stores can’t give change.
</p>

<h2>2. Don’t Store Cash in Obvious Hiding Spots</h2>

<p>
  Burglars go straight for the classic locations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Under the mattress</li>
  <li>Inside sock drawers</li>
  <li>Freezers</li>
  <li>Behind picture frames</li>
  <li>Inside desk drawers</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Avoid anything that appears in movies or crime shows. Thieves know those spots too.
</p>

<h2>3. Good Places to Store Cash</h2>

<p>
  You want locations that are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inconspicuous</li>
  <li>Protected from moisture and heat</li>
  <li>Easy for <em>you</em> to access quickly</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Reliable options include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inside a small fire-resistant safe</li>
  <li>Hidden compartment in a closet or utility room</li>
  <li>Containers disguised as everyday items</li>
  <li>Sealed envelopes stored inside binders or books</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Waterproof and Fire-Resistant Protection</h2>

<p>
  Water and heat ruin cash fast. Store bills in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plastic currency sleeves</li>
  <li>Ziploc freezer bags</li>
  <li>Fire-resistant envelopes</li>
  <li>A small fireproof safe (best option)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If storing cash in a safe, bolt it down—portable safes are often just carried out the door.
</p>

<h2>5. Cash for Evacuation: Ready to Grab</h2>

<p>
  Some cash should stay stored, but a portion should be instantly accessible during a fast evacuation.
  Keep a smaller stash inside:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your go-bag</li>
  <li>Your car emergency kit</li>
  <li>A wallet insert or sealed pouch</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For more details on what else to grab, read 
  <a href="evacuation-loading-priorities.html">Evacuation Loading Priorities</a>.
</p>

<h2>6. Don’t Mix Cash With Documents</h2>

<p>
  Keep cash separate from important documents like IDs, insurance paperwork, and titles. If a thief finds one envelope, 
  they shouldn’t get everything at once.
</p>

<h2>7. Refresh the Stash Periodically</h2>

<p>
  Check your emergency cash once or twice a year. Replace damaged bills, update amounts, and make sure the hiding place 
  hasn’t become too obvious.
</p>

<h2>8. Tell Exactly One Person (Optional)</h2>

<p>
  If you live with trusted family members, one additional person should know where the cash is in case you're injured or 
  separated. Don't tell more than one—that defeats the purpose.
</p>

<h2>9. The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  Emergency cash is simple but powerful. It covers the gaps when technology fails, systems go down, and stores can’t 
  process payments. Store it smart, keep it dry and hidden, and make sure you can grab it fast if you need to leave.

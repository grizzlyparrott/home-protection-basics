<h1>Avoiding Common Prep Mistakes: What Homeowners Get Wrong</h1>

<p>
  Most homeowners don’t fail at emergency prep because they’re lazy—they fail because they prep for the wrong things,
  assume disaster timelines will be convenient, or buy gear without systems. These are the most common mistakes and the 
  clean fixes that make real emergencies easier, not harder.
</p>

<p>
  If you need a baseline to compare your setup to, read 
  <a href="basic-home-emergency-kit-list.html">Basic Home Emergency Kit List</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. Building a Kit but Never Maintaining It</h2>

<p>
  Prep gear expires, batteries die, water leaks, and food goes stale. A kit that hasn’t been checked in two years is 
  barely better than having nothing at all.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Replace food every 6–12 months.</li>
  <li>Rotate water at least once a year.</li>
  <li>Swap batteries yearly or move to USB-rechargeable gear.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Set a calendar reminder—no one “remembers” this stuff naturally.
</p>

<h2>2. Overcomplicating the Gear</h2>

<p>
  Homeowners love buying advanced gear they’ll never use: giant trauma kits, military radios, or complex stoves they
  haven’t tested. Simpler gear you actually know how to use beats high-end gear you’ve never unboxed.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to know which cooking options actually work during outages, see 
  <a href="emergency-cooking-basics.html">Emergency Cooking Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>3. Ignoring Water Needs</h2>

<p>
  Water is the most universally underestimated category. People store a few bottles and call it good—then realize one
  gallon per person per day is the real minimum. Floods, pipe breaks, and contamination events can take your tap offline
  instantly.
</p>

<p>
  If you haven’t built a real water plan yet, read 
  <a href="emergency-water-filtration-basics.html">Emergency Water Filtration Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>4. Forgetting About Sanitation</h2>

<p>
  Disasters create a surprising amount of waste, and backed-up toilets happen in more emergencies than people think.
  Homeowners rarely pack trash bags, wipes, gloves, or sanitizer. It’s not glamorous, but it’s critical.
</p>

<p>
  For a step-by-step breakdown, see 
  <a href="emergency-sanitation-basics.html">Emergency Sanitation Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>5. Not Planning for Communication Failures</h2>

<p>
  Cell towers fail, overload, or lose backup power. A cheap emergency radio is the simplest fix but often the last thing 
  people buy. If you can’t get updates, you can’t make smart decisions.
</p>

<p>
  Learn how to build a basic plan in 
  <a href="communication-during-emergencies.html">Communication During Emergencies</a>.
</p>

<h2>6. Prepping Only for the Big, Rare Stuff</h2>

<p>
  Homeowners obsess over wildfires, earthquakes, or tornadoes—but forget the far more common problems: long outages,
  boil-water notices, contaminated tap water, chemical smells from industrial accidents, or extreme heat spikes.
</p>

<p>
  If your region is prone to severe temperature swings, you should also read 
  <a href="extreme-heat-prep-basics.html">Extreme Heat Prep Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>7. No Evacuation Plan</h2>

<p>
  Every family should know when to leave, where to go, and what route avoids the dangerous areas. “We’ll figure it out”
  is not a survival strategy.
</p>

<p>
  Build a real plan using 
  <a href="evacuation-route-planning.html">Evacuation Route Planning</a>.
</p>

<h2>8. Not Training the Household</h2>

<p>
  Gear is useless if only one person knows where it is or how it works. Everyone in the home should know how to turn off
  utilities, use a fire extinguisher, and find the emergency kits without digging.
</p>

<h2>9. Relying Solely on the Home</h2>

<p>
  If the house becomes uninhabitable, most people have no backup location or secondary plan. You need at least one 
  alternative place to go—a relative, neighbor, or local shelter.
</p>

<p>
  And if you're deciding whether to stay or leave during an event, use 
  <a href="bug-in-vs-bug-out-basics.html">Bug-In vs. Bug-Out Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>10. No System for Reviewing After an Event</h2>

<p>
  After any outage or emergency, walk through what worked and what didn’t. This prevents repeating mistakes and improves 
  your setup every time.

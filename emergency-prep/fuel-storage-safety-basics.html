          <h2>What Counts as “Fuel” in a Typical Home</h2>
          <p>
            When we talk about fuel storage for emergencies, most households are dealing with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Gasoline for vehicles, generators, and small engines</li>
            <li>Diesel for trucks, tractors, or some generators</li>
            <li>Propane in grill cylinders or larger home tanks</li>
            <li>Kerosene or heating oil for space heaters in some areas</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All of these are combustible or flammable. They give you options during <a href="power-outage-prep-basics.html">power outages</a> and other emergencies, but stored wrong they become a major fire and explosion risk.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Know Your Local Limits Before You Stock Up</h2>
          <p>
            Most fire codes limit how much gasoline and other fuels you can store at a residence, and where you can store it. Common rules:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Strict limits on gasoline volume inside attached garages or homes</li>
            <li>Bans on fuel storage in basements or living spaces</li>
            <li>Distance requirements from ignition sources and property lines</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Before you start stacking cans, check your city or county fire department website for residential fuel storage limits or call their non-emergency line. If you rent, your lease and landlord rules also matter.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Only Use Approved Containers (No Random Jugs)</h2>
          <p>
            Fuel belongs in containers designed for that specific product, not in milk jugs or old water bottles.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Gasoline:</strong> Red, labeled, UL- or DOT-approved gas cans with tight caps and working vents.</li>
            <li><strong>Diesel:</strong> Yellow, approved diesel cans or tanks.</li>
            <li><strong>Kerosene:</strong> Blue, clearly labeled kerosene containers.</li>
            <li><strong>Propane:</strong> Certified cylinders with intact valves and no visible damage or rust.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Every container should be labeled with the fuel type and the date you filled it. That keeps you from accidentally pouring stale fuel into your generator when you actually need it.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Where to Store Fuel: Location Matters More Than Volume</h2>
          <p>
            The basic rule: keep fuel <strong>cool, dry, ventilated, and away from ignition sources and people.</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Good options:</strong> Detached garage, well-ventilated shed, or an outdoor storage box designed for fuel.</li>
            <li><strong>Bad options:</strong> Inside the house, basement, utility closets, or next to water heaters, furnaces, or dryers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Store containers upright, off the ground if possible, and away from direct sun. Don’t stack heavy objects on top of cans or propane cylinders.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you already have a <a href="basic-home-emergency-kit-list.html">basic home emergency kit</a>, treat fuel as a separate risk category that deserves its own space and rules.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>How Much Fuel Is Reasonable to Store?</h2>
          <p>
            You’re trying to bridge short-term problems, not run a gas station out of your garage. Reasonable targets for most homes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Gasoline:</strong> Enough for one full generator tank plus one or two refills, and maybe one extra can for a vehicle.</li>
            <li><strong>Diesel:</strong> Enough to cover your specific diesel equipment for a few days of use.</li>
            <li><strong>Propane:</strong> One or two grill cylinders kept outside, plus whatever is in your main home tank if you use propane for heating.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you find yourself pushing up against code limits or filling entire walls with cans, you’re past “basic preparedness” and into “serious fire load” territory. Scale back or rethink the plan.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Fuel Rotation and Stabilizers</h2>
          <p>
            Gasoline, especially, doesn’t age well. Over time it breaks down, pulling in moisture and leaving varnish behind in carburetors and injectors.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Write the fill date on each can.</li>
            <li>Use fuel stabilizer if it will sit longer than a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Rotate cans into your vehicle or equipment every 3–6 months and refill with fresh fuel.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Propane and diesel are more stable but still need periodic inspection for leaks, rust, and water contamination. Make fuel checks part of your regular <a href="home-hazard-identification.html">home hazard walkthrough</a>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Handling Fuel and Refueling Safely</h2>
          <p>
            Most accidents happen while people are pouring or transferring fuel, not while it’s sitting in a can.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Always shut engines off and let them cool before refueling.</li>
            <li>Refuel generators and equipment outdoors on bare ground or concrete, not on a wood deck.</li>
            <li>Keep a rated fire extinguisher nearby any time you’re refueling.</li>
            <li>Clean up spills immediately and air out the area.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Don’t use fuel as a cleaner or fire starter. No “helping” a campfire or grill with a splash of gasoline. That’s how people end up in burn units.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Generators, Heaters, and the “Never Indoors” Rule</h2>
          <p>
            A lot of fuel storage is driven by generator and heater use during outages. Two absolute rules:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Never run a generator indoors</strong> or in an attached garage, even with the door open.</li>
            <li><strong>Never use fuel-burning space heaters that aren’t rated for indoor use</strong> without proper ventilation and carbon monoxide alarms.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Treat your fuel plan as part of your bigger <a href="power-bank-and-generator-basics.html">generator and backup power setup</a>. If you can’t run the device safely, storing extra fuel for it doesn’t help you.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Dealing With Old or Contaminated Fuel</h2>
          <p>
            At some point you’ll end up with fuel that’s clearly bad: sour smell, visible rust or water, or equipment that refuses to start when you use it.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Do not dump fuel on the ground, in storm drains, or in the trash.</li>
            <li>Call your local waste or recycling center and ask about hazardous waste drop-off days.</li>
            <li>Keep old fuel in clearly labeled containers until you can dispose of it properly.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Fixing one emergency by creating a slow environmental problem isn’t a win.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Fuel Storage Safety Checklist</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>I know my local fuel storage limits and follow them.</li>
            <li>All fuel is in approved, clearly labeled containers.</li>
            <li>Fuel is stored in a cool, ventilated area, away from ignition sources and living spaces.</li>
            <li>I rotate gasoline and other fuels on a set schedule.</li>
            <li>I have an appropriate fire extinguisher near my storage area.</li>
            <li>Everyone in the home knows generators and fuel-burning heaters are <strong>never</strong> used indoors.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once this is dialed in, you can safely support your <a href="non-perishable-food-basics.html">non-perishable food supplies</a>, water, and gear with reliable fuel instead of hoping the gas station still has power when you need it.

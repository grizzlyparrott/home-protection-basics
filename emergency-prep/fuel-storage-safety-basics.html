<h1>Fuel Storage Safety Basics: Gas, Diesel, and Propane at Home</h1>

<p>
  Fuel gives you options during an emergency: you can run a generator, drive out, cook, or heat. Stored wrong, the same
  fuel turns into a fire and explosion risk sitting 10 feet from your water heater. This guide walks through how much to
  store, where to put it, and the basic rules that keep your home on the right side of that line.
</p>

<p>
  If you’re still building out the rest of your supplies, start with the 
  <a href="basic-home-emergency-kit-list.html">Basic Home Emergency Kit List</a> and then layer fuel on top of that plan.
</p>

<h2>1. What Counts as “Fuel” in a Normal Home</h2>

<p>
  Most households aren’t dealing with drums and tanks. You’re usually handling:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gasoline for vehicles, generators, and lawn equipment</li>
  <li>Diesel for trucks, tractors, or some generators</li>
  <li>Propane in grill cylinders or a larger home tank</li>
  <li>Occasional kerosene or heating oil for space heaters</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Every one of these is flammable or combustible. The goal is simple: store enough to get you through short-term problems
  like <a href="power-outage-prep-basics.html">power outages</a> or short evacuations without turning your garage or shed
  into a concentrated fuel load.
</p>

<h2>2. Know Your Local Limits Before You Stock Up</h2>

<p>
  Fire codes usually cap how much gasoline and other fuels you can store at home and where you’re allowed to store them.
  Common rules include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Limits on total gallons of gasoline in attached garages</li>
  <li>Bans on storing fuel in basements or living spaces</li>
  <li>Distance requirements from ignition sources and property lines</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Before you buy extra cans “just in case,” check your city or county fire department website or call their non-emergency
  line. If you rent, your lease may also restrict fuel storage. Ignoring those rules is a fast way to get in trouble after
  an inspection or a fire.
</p>

<h2>3. Only Use Approved Containers (No Random Jugs)</h2>

<p>
  Fuel doesn’t belong in milk jugs, soda bottles, or whatever empty container is nearby. Use containers designed for the
  specific product:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gasoline:</strong> Red, UL- or DOT-approved gas cans with good caps and working vents</li>
  <li><strong>Diesel:</strong> Yellow, clearly labeled diesel cans or tanks</li>
  <li><strong>Kerosene:</strong> Blue containers marked for kerosene</li>
  <li><strong>Propane:</strong> Certified cylinders with undamaged valves and no deep rust</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Label each container with the fuel type and the fill date. That stops you from pouring stale fuel into your generator
  the first time you actually need it.
</p>

<h2>4. Where to Store Fuel So It’s There When You Need It</h2>

<p>
  Location matters more than the exact number of gallons. The basics:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Good spots:</strong> Detached garages, well-ventilated sheds, or outdoor lockers built for fuel</li>
  <li><strong>Bad spots:</strong> Inside the house, basements, utility closets, or next to furnaces and water heaters</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Keep containers upright, out of direct sun, and away from anything that sparks or flames. Don’t stack heavy items on top
  of fuel cans or propane cylinders. If you’re building a broader <a href="home-hazard-identification.html">home hazard
  plan</a>, treat fuel storage as its own high-priority risk area.
</p>

<h2>5. How Much Fuel Is Actually Reasonable?</h2>

<p>
  You’re not trying to run a gas station. You’re trying to ride out a short disruption or a few days of evacuation. A
  reasonable starting point for most homes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gasoline:</strong> Enough for one full generator tank plus one to two refills, and maybe one small extra can for a vehicle</li>
  <li><strong>Diesel:</strong> Only what you realistically need for your diesel equipment</li>
  <li><strong>Propane:</strong> One or two grill cylinders stored outside, plus whatever is in a permanent home tank</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you’re stacking cans to the ceiling, you’ve moved well past basic preparedness and into “large fuel load” territory.
  Either scale back or rethink how you’re planning to power things during a long outage.
</p>

<h2>6. Rotation, Stabilizers, and Shelf Life</h2>

<p>
  Gasoline breaks down over time. It absorbs moisture, loses volatility, and leaves varnish in small engines. To keep your
  stored fuel usable:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write the fill date on every can</li>
  <li>Add fuel stabilizer if you expect it to sit more than a couple of months</li>
  <li>Rotate fuel into your vehicles or equipment every 3–6 months and refill with fresh</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Diesel and propane hold up better but still deserve regular checks for leaks, rust, or water in storage. Include fuel
  in your normal emergency-prep review just like you would your <a href="non-perishable-food-basics.html">non-perishable
  food</a> and water.
</p>

<h2>7. Refueling Without Creating a Bigger Problem</h2>

<p>
  Most accidents happen while someone is pouring fuel, not while it’s sitting on a shelf. Keep it simple:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shut engines off and let them cool before refueling</li>
  <li>Refuel generators and equipment outside on bare ground or concrete, not on a wood deck</li>
  <li>Keep a properly rated fire extinguisher nearby when fueling</li>
  <li>Clean up spills immediately and let fumes clear before restarting equipment</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Don’t use gasoline or other fuels as “shortcuts” to start grills, fire pits, or burn piles. That’s how people end up in
  the burn unit.
</p>

<h2>8. Generators, Heaters, and the “Never Indoors” Rule</h2>

<p>
  A lot of people stock fuel because they’re planning to run generators or heaters during outages. Two hard rules:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Never run a generator indoors</strong> or in an attached garage, even with the door open</li>
  <li><strong>Never bring outdoor-only heaters inside</strong>, no matter how cold it is</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Carbon monoxide will build up faster than you think, and you won’t smell it. Plan your fuel storage and usage as part of
  a complete <a href="power-bank-and-generator-basics.html">backup power strategy</a>, not a desperate last-minute move
  in the middle of the storm.
</p>

<h2>9. What to Do With Old or Bad Fuel</h2>

<p>
  Sooner or later you’ll have fuel that’s clearly off—bad smell, visible rust or water, or equipment that won’t start when
  you use it.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t dump fuel on the ground or pour it into storm drains</li>
  <li>Don’t put liquid fuel in regular household trash</li>
  <li>Call your local waste or recycling center and ask about hazardous waste drop-off options</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Keep old fuel in labeled containers and get rid of it through proper channels. Fixing one emergency by creating a slow,
  long-term environmental problem doesn’t help you.
</p>

<h2>10. Pulling It Together</h2>

<p>
  A sane fuel plan is simple: follow local limits, use proper containers, store fuel in the right place, rotate it on a
  schedule, and use it with equipment the way it was designed. Do that, and you’ll have the fuel you need to support your
  <a href="water-storage-basics.html">water storage</a>, food, and evacuation plans without adding an avoidable fire or
  carbon monoxide risk to your home.

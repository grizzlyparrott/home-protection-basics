<h1>Emergency Radio Basics: Staying Informed When the Grid Goes Down</h1>

<p>
  When the power is out and cell networks are overloaded, an emergency radio is often the only reliable way to know 
  what’s going on. It doesn’t care about apps, data plans, or Wi-Fi—it just pulls broadcast signals out of the air and 
  feeds you weather alerts, evacuation orders, and local news.
</p>

<p>
  If you haven’t built out your overall communication plan yet, read 
  <a href="communication-during-emergencies.html">Communication During Emergencies</a> 
  after this.
</p>

<h2>1. What an Emergency Radio Actually Does</h2>

<p>
  Emergency radios are built to do three things well:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Receive AM/FM news and talk radio</li>
  <li>Receive weather alerts from NOAA or local services</li>
  <li>Run on multiple power sources when the grid is down</li>
</ul>

<p>
  They’re not entertainment devices. They’re your backup connection to reality when everything else goes dark.
</p>

<h2>2. Must-Have Features</h2>

<p>
  Look for these features first. If a radio doesn’t have at least most of them, skip it:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>NOAA weather band support</strong> for official weather and hazard alerts</li>
  <li><strong>AM/FM bands</strong> for local stations and news</li>
  <li><strong>Multiple power options</strong>: batteries, hand crank, solar, or USB</li>
  <li><strong>Headphone jack</strong> so you can listen quietly at night</li>
  <li><strong>Built-in flashlight</strong> (useful, but not mandatory)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Anything beyond this—Bluetooth, fancy speakers, etc.—is extra, not essential.
</p>

<h2>3. Power Options: How to Keep It Running</h2>

<p>
  A dead radio is just a brick. Common power setups include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Replaceable batteries</strong>: simple and reliable, as long as you store extras</li>
  <li><strong>Hand crank</strong>: slow but works forever if you’re willing to turn it</li>
  <li><strong>Solar panel</strong>: useful in long daylight outages, weak in heavy storms</li>
  <li><strong>USB charging</strong>: convenient with power banks or car chargers</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The best radios combine at least two or three of these so you’re never stuck with a single point of failure.
</p>

<p>
  For help building the rest of your power and lighting setup, see 
  <a href="backup-lighting-options.html">Backup Lighting Options</a>.
</p>

<h2>4. Where an Emergency Radio Fits in Your Kit</h2>

<p>
  Your radio should live with your core emergency supplies, not buried in a random drawer. A good place is inside or 
  next to your main kit from 
  <a href="basic-home-emergency-kit-list.html">Basic Home Emergency Kit List</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Keep it:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stored with spare batteries or a power bank</li>
  <li>Close to flashlights and headlamps</li>
  <li>Easy to grab during an evacuation</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. How to Use an Emergency Radio Effectively</h2>

<p>
  Don’t wait for an actual disaster to touch the thing. At a minimum:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turn it on and find your local AM/FM news stations</li>
  <li>Identify which NOAA or weather channels broadcast in your area</li>
  <li>Practice switching between bands in the dark</li>
</ul>

<p>
  During an event, check it regularly for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Updated storm tracks</li>
  <li>Evacuation or shelter-in-place orders</li>
  <li>Road closures and fuel availability</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Radios and Your Family Communication Plan</h2>

<p>
  Radios don’t let you talk back, but they keep you from making decisions in the dark. Your family communication plan 
  should assume phones fail and radios fill the information gap.
</p>

<p>
  For the people in your household, decide:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who is responsible for grabbing the radio during evacuations</li>
  <li>Where it lives when not in use</li>
  <li>How often you test it (every 3–6 months works)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  To tie this into your overall planning, see 
  <a href="family-communication-plan-basics.html">Family Communication Plan Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>7. Car vs. Home Radios</h2>

<p>
  Your car radio is useful, but it’s not enough:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cars require fuel and safe roads</li>
  <li>You may not want to idle just to listen to news</li>
  <li>You can’t keep a running car inside a garage without CO danger</li>
</ul>

<p>
  A dedicated emergency radio sits in your home, uses almost no power, and works even when you can’t or shouldn’t move 
  your vehicle. For what else your car should carry, see 
  <a href="car-emergency-kit-basics.html">Car Emergency Kit Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>8. Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  An emergency radio is one of the cheapest pieces of gear that can genuinely change how you handle a disaster. It keeps 
  you plugged into reality when rumors, half-truths, and social media noise are useless. Get one, power it correctly, 
  and actually learn how to use it before you need it.

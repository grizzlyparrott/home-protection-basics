<h1>Protecting Important Documents at Home: Keep Them Safe, Dry, and Findable</h1>

<p>
  When an emergency hits, you don’t have time to dig through drawers to find birth certificates, insurance policies,
  medical paperwork, or financial records. And if a fire, flood, or break-in hits first, those documents can disappear
  forever. This guide shows how to protect them against water, heat, theft, and panic.
</p>

<p>
  To connect this with broader evacuation planning, pair it with your  
  <a href="go-bag-checklist.html">Go-Bag Checklist</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. Know Which Documents Actually Matter</h2>

<p>
  These are the documents you should always protect first:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Birth certificates, Social Security cards, passports</li>
  <li>Home, auto, and health insurance policies</li>
  <li>Medical records and prescription lists</li>
  <li>Property records, deeds, and mortgage documents</li>
  <li>Financial account info (statements, loan documents)</li>
  <li>Wills, power of attorney, and legal paperwork</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You don’t need to preserve every receipt you’ve ever touched. Focus on the core identity, financial, legal, and
  medical items.
</p>

<h2>2. Use Fireproof and Waterproof Protection</h2>

<p>
  The best way to store important documents at home:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fireproof, waterproof document safe rated for at least 30 minutes at 1,500°F</li>
  <li>Waterproof document bags for grab-and-go storage</li>
  <li>A second copy kept offsite if possible</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Ordinary safes often fail during house fires. Look for UL-rated fireproof safes, not cheap “fire resistant” boxes.
</p>

<h2>3. Digitize Everything</h2>

<p>
  Digital backups save you when the physical copies get damaged or lost. Scan:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>IDs and passports</li>
  <li>Insurance policies</li>
  <li>Medical records</li>
  <li>Legal documents</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Store encrypted copies on both a cloud service and a USB drive kept in your fireproof safe.
</p>

<h2>4. Keep Documents Organized for Fast Evacuation</h2>

<p>
  Emergencies don’t give you time to think. Keep:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A dedicated folder inside your safe</li>
  <li>A waterproof pouch you can grab in 10 seconds</li>
  <li>Printed contact lists and account numbers</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These should live in the same spot every day—your future self will thank you.
</p>

<h2>5. Don’t Store Documents in the Worst Places</h2>

<p>
  Avoid storing paperwork in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basements (flooding)</li>
  <li>Attics (heat damage)</li>
  <li>Garage cabinets (heat + humidity)</li>
  <li>Random piles or “junk drawers”</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If moisture or heat can get in, your paperwork won’t last.
</p>

<h2>6. Update Documents Regularly</h2>

<p>
  Documents change—insurance renews, accounts close, medical needs shift. Update your safe at least twice a year when
  you update your  
  <a href="home-hazard-identification.html">home hazard review</a> or refresh your  
  <a href="basic-home-emergency-kit-list.html">emergency kit</a>.
</p>

<h2>7. Offsite Storage Options</h2>

<p>
  For maximum redundancy, consider one of these:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A small bank safe-deposit box</li>
  <li>A trusted family member in another state</li>
  <li>An encrypted digital vault</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Never rely on one location for everything you care about.
</p>

<h2>8. The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  Critical documents are irreplaceable and expensive to recover. Fireproof storage, waterproof pouches, digital backups,
  and consistent organization ensure they survive disasters and can be grabbed quickly during an evacuation. Protect
  them now so you’re not dealing with bureaucracy when everything else is already going wrong.

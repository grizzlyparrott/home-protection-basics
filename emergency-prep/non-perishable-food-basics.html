<h1>Non-Perishable Food Basics: Building a Simple, Reliable Supply</h1>

<p>
  Non-perishable food keeps you fed when storms cut power, stores close, or evacuation becomes necessary. You don’t need a
  bunker or a year's worth of rations—just enough reliable meals to bridge the gap until normal life resumes. This guide
  explains what to buy, how much to stash, and how to avoid the common mistakes people make when they panic-shop.
</p>

<p>
  For water storage guidance to round out your supplies, see  
  <a href="water-storage-basics.html">Water Storage Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. What Counts as “Non-Perishable”?</h2>

<p>
  “Non-perishable” simply means food that stays safe and edible at room temperature for long periods. Common examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Canned vegetables, beans, and meats</li>
  <li>Dry goods like rice, pasta, and oats</li>
  <li>Peanut butter and shelf-stable snacks</li>
  <li>Ready-to-eat meals and dehydrated foods</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Focus on foods you actually like and will use. Otherwise you’ll end up throwing half of it out.
</p>

<h2>2. How Much You Actually Need</h2>

<p>
  A basic home supply targets several days of simple meals. A realistic starting point:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>3–7 days of food for each person</li>
  <li>Mix of ready-to-eat items and quick-cook items</li>
  <li>Extra for infants, pets, or special diets</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This isn’t meant to replace your full pantry. It’s the backup layer you rely on when you can’t shop normally.
</p>

<h2>3. Keep It Simple: Pick Foods You’ll Actually Eat</h2>

<p>
  Don’t buy obscure survival foods if you hate them. Stick with:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Canned soups and stews</li>
  <li>Instant rice or noodles</li>
  <li>Protein sources like canned chicken, tuna, beans, or chili</li>
  <li>Whole-grain crackers, granola bars, nuts</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Avoid anything that requires long cook times or lots of water. During outages, you’ll often be cooking on limited fuel.
</p>

<h2>4. Storage Rules That Make It Last</h2>

<p>
  Non-perishables last longer when you store them right:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cool, dry closet or pantry</li>
  <li>Avoid garages and sheds (heat kills shelf life)</li>
  <li>Keep items in airtight containers if pests are common</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Label each item with a marker if expiration dates are hard to see.
</p>

<h2>5. Build a Rotation System</h2>

<p>
  The simplest way to keep your supply fresh is a “first in, first out” rotation:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Put new items at the back</li>
  <li>Use older items first</li>
  <li>Replace what you use during normal cooking</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Rotation prevents the classic problem: a shelf full of expired cans right when you need them.
</p>

<h2>6. Add Variety Without Overpacking</h2>

<p>
  You don’t need gourmet meals, but a little variety helps morale. Add:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Different flavors of soups and pastas</li>
  <li>Quick snacks that don’t require prep</li>
  <li>Comfort items like instant coffee, cookies, cocoa</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These small boosts matter during long outages or stressful evacuations.
</p>

<h2>7. Special Diets, Kids, and Pets</h2>

<p>
  Plan for the actual people (and animals) in your home:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Low-sodium or allergy-friendly options</li>
  <li>Formula and kid-friendly snacks</li>
  <li>Pet food stored in airtight bins</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you rely on baby formula, buy small amounts frequently instead of large stockpiles to avoid waste.
</p>

<h2>8. Cooking Without Power</h2>

<p>
  During outages, your food plan should match your fuel plan. Use:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grill or camp stove (outdoors only)</li>
  <li>Small propane cookers</li>
  <li>Ready-to-eat meals requiring no heat</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you need proper fuel safety rules, read  
  <a href="fuel-storage-safety-basics.html">Fuel Storage Safety Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>9. The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  A solid non-perishable food supply isn’t complicated. Buy foods you like, store them correctly, rotate them on a simple
  schedule, and keep enough to bridge a few days of disruption. When you treat it like part of your normal pantry instead
  of a survival project, it stays fresh, useful, and ready when you need it.

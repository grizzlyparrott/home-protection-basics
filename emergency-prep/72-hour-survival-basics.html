    <h1>72-Hour Survival Basics</h1>
    <p>Your entire job in the first three days of a disaster is simple: stay alive with the supplies you already have. Here’s what matters, nothing more.</p>

      <h2>Why the First 72 Hours Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Emergency services are usually overwhelmed, roads are blocked, communication is spotty, and stores are empty. The first 72 hours are the window where you’re on your own. Your kit must cover the basics: water, food, light, communication, sanitation, and medical needs.

    <section>
      <h2>Water: The Non-Negotiable Item</h2>
      <p>
        You need one gallon of water per person per day—minimum. That’s drinking, hygiene, and basic cooking. Store sealed jugs or bottles, and keep a portable filtration system as backup. If you want a full breakdown of water safety, see 
        <a href="emergency-water-filtration-basics.html">Emergency Water Filtration Basics</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Food That Actually Holds Up</h2>
      <p>
        You want calories that are shelf-stable, require zero cooking, and won’t spoil if the power dies. Canned goods, protein bars, nuts, and ready-to-eat meals are the easiest options. Don’t overthink it—your goal is survival, not comfort.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Light: Seeing in the Dark Isn’t Optional</h2>
      <p>
        A disaster without lighting turns dangerous fast. Keep a headlamp, a small flashlight, and at least one lantern. Batteries or rechargeable USB power banks are mandatory. For bigger lighting setups, see 
        <a href="backup-lighting-options.html">Backup Lighting Options</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Communication Tools that Work When Everything Else Doesn’t</h2>
      <p>
        Cell towers fail. Power grids fail. You need a battery-powered or hand-crank emergency radio to receive updates. A whistle and a simple write-on clipboard help with local communication. If you want the bigger breakdown, check 
        <a href="communication-during-emergencies.html">Communication During Emergencies</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Basic Medical Supplies</h2>
      <p>
        A 72-hour kit needs bandages, antiseptic, gauze, gloves, tape, tweezers, pain relievers, and any personal prescriptions. Don’t try building a full trauma bag—you’re not replacing EMS. You’re just stabilizing until help can reach you.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sanitation Supplies</h2>
      <p>
        Hygiene goes downhill fast in a crisis, and that’s how infections start. Pack wipes, trash bags, gloves, hand sanitizer, and a small amount of toilet paper. For in-depth sanitation guidance, see 
        <a href="emergency-sanitation-basics.html">Emergency Sanitation Basics</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Tools & Gear</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Multi-tool</li>
        <li>Duct tape</li>
        <li>Paracord</li>
        <li>Small pry bar</li>
        <li>Portable battery packs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Keep it simple—you’re not doing wilderness survival; you’re surviving at home or sheltering in place.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Documents & Cash</h2>
      <p>
        Keep copies of IDs, insurance papers, and emergency contacts in a waterproof pouch. Add at least small-value cash—ATMs and card readers won’t work if the grid is down.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Check: Can You Survive Three Days Right Now?</h2>
      <p>
        If the answer is no, fix it. A 72-hour kit is basic preparedness, not hardcore prepping. This is the bare minimum every household should maintain.

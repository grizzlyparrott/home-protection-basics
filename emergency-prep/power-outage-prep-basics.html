<h1>Power Outage Prep Basics: Staying Safe When the Lights Go Out</h1>

<p>
  Power outages are one of the most common emergencies homeowners face. Storms, equipment failures, heat waves, and
  grid issues can knock power out with zero warning. This guide covers the basics—lighting, food safety, backup power,
  and how to avoid the dangerous mistakes that cause fires or carbon monoxide poisoning every year.
</p>

<p>

  <a href="power-bank-and-generator-basics.html">Power Bank and Generator Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. Build a Simple Lighting Kit</h2>

<p>
  Light is the first thing you’ll miss. Don’t rely on candles—they’re a fire hazard during chaotic conditions. Instead:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flashlights for each person</li>
  <li>Headlamps for hands-free tasks</li>
  <li>Battery-powered lanterns</li>
  <li>Plenty of spare batteries</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Keep your lighting kit in a single drawer or container you can grab instantly.
</p>

<h2>2. Keep Your Phone Alive</h2>

<p>
  Communication becomes critical when utilities fail. Use:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>High-capacity power banks (20,000mAh+)</li>
  <li>Car chargers as a backup charging method</li>
  <li>Low-power mode to extend battery life</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Charge everything early—blackouts rarely give a countdown.
</p>

<h2>3. Food and Water Safety</h2>

<p>
  Fridges and freezers hold temperature longer than most people think, but only if you leave them closed:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Refrigerator:</strong> 4 hours closed</li>
  <li><strong>Freezer (full):</strong> 48 hours closed</li>
  <li><strong>Freezer (half):</strong> ~24 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If water contamination is possible, switch to bottled or boiled water. For long-term planning, see  
  <a href="non-perishable-food-basics.html">Non-Perishable Food Basics</a> and  
  <a href="water-storage-basics.html">Water Storage Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>4. Heating and Cooling Without Power</h2>

<p>
  Temperature control becomes a survival issue faster than people expect. Basics:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dress in layers to conserve heat</li>
  <li>Close off unused rooms</li>
  <li>Use battery-powered fans in heat waves</li>
  <li>Avoid opening windows during storms or wildfire smoke</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Never use grills or camp stoves indoors—CO risk is fatal.
</p>

<h2>5. Generator Safety Rules</h2>

<p>
  If you use a generator, follow the rules every time:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Never run it indoors or in a garage</li>
  <li>Keep it 20+ feet from windows</li>
  <li>Use outdoor-rated extension cords</li>
  <li>Store fuel safely and rotate it</li>
</ul>

<p>

  <a href="power-bank-and-generator-basics.html">Power Bank and Generator Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>6. Medication and Medical Devices</h2>

<p>
  Outages complicate anything that needs electricity or refrigeration. Prepare:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Insulated pouches or small coolers for refrigerated medication</li>
  <li>Backup batteries for medical devices</li>
  <li>Printed medication lists in case digital records are inaccessible</li>
</ul>

<p>
  More details are in  
  <a href="medication-management-during-emergencies.html">Medication Management During Emergencies</a>.
</p>

<h2>7. Entertainment and Morale</h2>

<p>
  Boredom makes long outages miserable, especially for kids. Low-tech options:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Books</li>
  <li>Battery-powered radios</li>
  <li>Board games or card decks</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These keep frustration down when screens and devices go dark.
</p>

<h2>8. The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  Power outages are unavoidable, but misery isn’t. With good lighting, backup power, safe food practices, and a simple
  plan for heating and cooling, you can ride out everything from a two-hour blackout to a multi-day grid failure. Most
  of the work happens before the outage—so prepare now, not when the lights are already off.

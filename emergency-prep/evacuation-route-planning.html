<h1>Evacuation Route Planning: The Fastest Path Out When Every Second Counts</h1>

<p>
  Most people wait until the last minute to figure out how they’re leaving an area—and that’s exactly why they end up  
  stuck in traffic, trapped by road closures, or driving straight into danger. Planning evacuation routes ahead of time  
  removes the guesswork and gives your family a clear, fast path out.
</p>

<p>
  For what to actually pack once you start loading the car, see  
  <a href="evacuation-loading-priorities.html">Evacuation Loading Priorities</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. Know the Disasters in Your Area</h2>

<p>
  Route planning depends on what you’re likely to face. Identify whether you’re in a zone for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wildfires</li>
  <li>Flooding</li>
  <li>Hurricanes</li>
  <li>Tornadoes</li>
  <li>Chemical or industrial accidents</li>
  <li>Earthquakes (roads may be damaged)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each hazard changes which routes stay safe and which ones become deadly.
</p>

<h2>2. Build Three Different Routes</h2>

<p>
  Never rely on one exit. You need:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Primary Route:</strong> Fastest and simplest way out</li>
  <li><strong>Secondary Route:</strong> Avoids major roads, meant for congestion</li>
  <li><strong>Tertiary (Last-Resort) Route:</strong> Back roads or alternate directions</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If your main route is the same one everyone else will take, expect immediate gridlock.
</p>

<h2>3. Avoid Known Choke Points</h2>

<p>
  Certain locations always jam up during evacuations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bridges</li>
  <li>Tunnels</li>
  <li>Highway merges</li>
  <li>Narrow canyon roads</li>
  <li>Busy intersections</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If your primary route uses one of these, your backup routes should avoid them entirely.
</p>

<h2>4. Map Safe Zones and Destinations</h2>

<p>
  Don’t just pick a road—pick a destination:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Friend or family home outside the hazard zone</li>
  <li>Hotel cluster with multiple options</li>
  <li>Official evacuation shelters</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You need somewhere safe to go after you leave the danger zone.
</p>

<h2>5. Plan for Special Road Closures</h2>

<p>
  Some disasters cause predictable road closures:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wildfires may close roads based on wind direction</li>
  <li>Floods cut off low-lying bridges first</li>
  <li>Hurricanes often reverse highways for outbound traffic</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Your plan should account for which roads disappear first.
</p>

<h2>6. Practice Your Routes</h2>

<p>
  Drive them when the weather is good and traffic is normal. You want to know:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where the bottlenecks are</li>
  <li>Where construction zones appear</li>
  <li>How long each route realistically takes</li>
  <li>Where gas stations and stores are located along the way</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Practice prevents hesitation during the real thing.
</p>

<h2>7. Keep Maps in the Car</h2>

<p>
  GPS fails. Cell towers fail. You still need to navigate. Keep:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Printed maps of your region</li>
  <li>A state highway map</li>
  <li>A compass (optional but smart)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  A dead phone shouldn’t end your evacuation.
</p>

<h2>8. Keep Fuel Above Half a Tank</h2>

<p>
  Evacuations often involve sitting in traffic or driving long distances. Don’t let your tank drop below half—ever.
</p>

</p>

<h2>9. Plan for Pets</h2>

<p>
  Pets complicate evacuations if you don’t plan ahead. Know:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which hotels accept pets</li>
  <li>Which shelters allow or reject animals</li>
  <li>Where your carriers and leashes are kept</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Pets should never delay your departure.
</p>

<h2>10. Communication During Evacuations</h2>

<p>
  Family members may become separated. Use:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pre-set meeting points</li>
  <li>A shared map of the planned routes</li>
  <li>An out-of-town contact person</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2>11. Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  Evacuation isn’t complicated—it’s just stressful. Planning your routes early removes most of the panic and gives your 
  family a clear path to follow. Build three routes, practice them, keep your car ready, and leave before everyone else 
  decides to flee at the same time.

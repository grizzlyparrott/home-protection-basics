<h1>Home Hazard Identification: Spotting Risks Before They Hurt You</h1>

<p>
  Most emergencies that happen inside the home don’t come out of nowhere. The warning signs were sitting in plain sight—
  frayed cords, overloaded outlets, leaking pipes, missing smoke alarms, cracked steps, blocked vents, or fuel stored in
  the wrong place. This guide walks you through how to spot those risks during a simple walkthrough so you can fix them
  before they turn into injuries, fires, or expensive damage.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to map these hazards visually, pair this with  
  <a href="home-hazard-map-basics.html">Home Hazard Map Basics</a> to turn your notes into an actual plan.
</p>

<h2>1. Electrical Hazards</h2>

<p>
  Electrical issues are one of the most common causes of home fires. Look for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Overloaded power strips or daisy-chained extension cords</li>
  <li>Damaged or frayed cables</li>
  <li>Outlets that spark, buzz, or feel warm</li>
  <li>Missing outlet covers in homes with kids</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you find repeated breaker trips or lights that flicker when appliances run, don’t ignore it. That’s your electrical
  system telling you something is wrong.
</p>

<h2>2. Fire Hazards</h2>

<p>
  A fire hazard is anything that can ignite easily or burn fast, and most homes have plenty:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clutter near stoves or heaters</li>
  <li>Grease buildup in kitchens</li>
  <li>Dryer vents packed with lint</li>
  <li>Stored gasoline, propane, or chemicals in the wrong location</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For proper fuel storage rules, see  
  <a href="fuel-storage-safety-basics.html">Fuel Storage Safety Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>3. Gas and Carbon Monoxide Hazards</h2>

<p>
  Natural gas or propane leaks can escalate fast. Watch for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Smell of gas or hissing near appliances</li>
  <li>Yellow or flickering gas appliance flames</li>
  <li>CO alarms missing or past their expiration</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you have fuel-burning heaters or a generator, make sure you’ve read  
  <a href="power-outage-prep-basics.html">Power Outage Prep Basics</a> so you’re not creating a CO problem during storms.
</p>

<h2>4. Water & Mold Hazards</h2>

<p>
  Water damage is slow, expensive, and usually avoidable. During your walkthrough, check for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leaking pipes under sinks or behind appliances</li>
  <li>Soft spots on floors or bubbling paint</li>
  <li>Mold or musty odors in corners or closets</li>
  <li>Blocked gutters causing water to pool near the foundation</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Fix leaks immediately. Mold spreads fast and becomes expensive even faster.
</p>

<h2>5. Structural Hazards</h2>

<p>
  These are the physical problems that injure people—especially kids and older adults:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Loose handrails</li>
  <li>Cracked steps or uneven flooring</li>
  <li>Missing or broken stair lighting</li>
  <li>Loose rugs that slide on hard floors</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you or someone in your home has mobility challenges, add this to your 
  <a href="shelter-in-place-basics.html">Shelter-in-Place Basics</a> plan so hazards don’t trap anyone in place.
</p>

<h2>6. Outdoor Hazards</h2>

<p>
  Don’t ignore the perimeter of your home. Issues outside can cause emergencies inside:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dead or unstable trees near the house</li>
  <li>Loose roofing or siding</li>
  <li>Poor exterior lighting</li>
  <li>Unsecured items that can become projectiles during storms</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Combine this with whatever regional threats you face—wildfires, hurricanes, severe storms—and adjust accordingly.
</p>

<h2>7. Hazard Prioritization</h2>

<p>
  Not every problem is equal. Fix hazards in this order:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Immediate danger:</strong> gas smell, exposed wiring, CO alarm missing</li>
  <li><strong>High risk:</strong> damaged electrical cords, leaking pipes, broken steps</li>
  <li><strong>Medium risk:</strong> cluttered hallways, minor roof damage</li>
  <li><strong>Low risk:</strong> cosmetic issues with no safety impact</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The goal is simple: remove the dangers that can seriously injure someone or destroy the home first.
</p>

<h2>8. How Often to Do a Hazard Walkthrough</h2>

<p>
  Twice a year is realistic. Many homeowners tie it to seasonal maintenance or time changes. If you’re building a larger
  disaster prep routine, bundle it with the checks you already do for your 
  <a href="go-bag-checklist.html">go-bag</a> or your 
  <a href="home-first-aid-kit-basics.html">home first aid kit</a>.
</p>

<h2>9. The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  Hazards don’t fix themselves. A 20–30 minute walkthrough lets you spot fire, electrical, gas, water, and structural
  risks before they hurt someone or turn into expensive emergencies. Keep the walkthrough simple, consistent, and focused
  on the problems that actually matter.

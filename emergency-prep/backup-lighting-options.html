<h1>Backup Lighting Options: Staying Lit During Outages</h1>

<p>
  Power outages turn dangerous fast when you can’t see anything—falls, debris, broken glass, and blocked exits turn into
  real problems. Good backup lighting makes your home usable and keeps injuries down. Here are the options that work and 
  the ones worth skipping.
</p>

<p>
  If you want a broader 72-hour plan for outages, read 
  <a href="72-hour-survival-basics.html">72-Hour Survival Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. Headlamps: The Most Useful Light You Can Own</h2>

<p>
  A headlamp beats almost every other form of backup lighting. It keeps your hands free, points exactly where you’re 
  looking, and works while carrying supplies or navigating stairs.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose USB-rechargeable models for simplicity.</li>
  <li>Have one for every adult in the home.</li>
  <li>Keep spare batteries or a power bank nearby.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. LED Lanterns for Room Lighting</h2>

<p>
  Lanterns light up a whole room and make longer outages livable. They’re safer than candles, last much longer, and 
  don’t tip easily if you buy a stable design.
</p>

<p>
  Look for lanterns with:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multiple brightness modes</li>
  <li>USB output for charging phones</li>
  <li>Long runtime on low mode</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If your lantern is battery-heavy, store extra batteries in a sealed bag to prevent corrosion.
</p>

<h2>3. Flashlights for Spot Tasks</h2>

<p>
  Flashlights aren’t the best primary light source, but they’re great for quick checks: breaker box, backyard, car, shed,
  or garage. Small LED flashlights work best when paired with headlamps and lanterns.
</p>

<h2>4. Portable Power Banks</h2>

<p>
  Good lighting means nothing if you can’t keep it charged. A few mid-sized power banks (10,000–20,000 mAh) are ideal 
  for topping off headlamps, radios, and phones through short-term outages.
</p>

  <a href="communication-during-emergencies.html">Communication During Emergencies</a>.
</p>

<h2>5. Solar Chargers (Slow but Useful)</h2>

<p>
  Small solar panels won’t recharge everything quickly, but they’re valuable during multi-day outages with good weather.
  They keep phones, radios, and small lights afloat without draining your battery stash.
</p>

<h2>6. Candles: Last Resort Only</h2>

<p>
  Candles are nostalgic but dangerous. They’re fire hazards, especially around pets, kids, clutter, or wind drafts. They 
  also create soot and barely light a room. Keep a few tea lights as absolute last-resort options—not primary lighting.
</p>

<h2>7. Glow Sticks for Temporary Safety Marking</h2>

<p>
  Cheap and disposable, glow sticks are great for marking hallways, stair edges, or kids’ rooms in total darkness. They’re 
  not “lighting” but they prevent falls, which matters.
</p>

<h2>8. Backup Lighting Storage Checklist</h2>

<p>
  Store lighting together so you’re not digging during a blackout. A small tote should include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Headlamps for each adult</li>
  <li>2–3 LED lanterns</li>
  <li>1–2 flashlights</li>
  <li>Power banks + charging cables</li>
  <li>Spare batteries in a sealed bag</li>
  <li>Optional small solar panel</li>
</ul>

<h1>Chemical Spill Preparedness: Protecting Your Home and Lungs</h1>

<p>
  Chemical spills don’t give you much warning. They happen fast—train derailments, tanker crashes, industrial leaks—sending 
  fumes into neighborhoods before most people even know there’s a problem. This guide keeps your exposure low and your 
  reactions smart.
</p>

<p>
  If you’re choosing whether to stay or leave during any emergency, first read 
  <a href="bug-in-vs-bug-out-basics.html">Bug-In vs. Bug-Out Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. Know the Warning Signs of a Chemical Release</h2>

<p>
  Not every chemical leak smells strong or obvious. Some are invisible. But typical red flags include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strong chemical, chlorine, or ammonia-like odors</li>
  <li>Haze, fog, or odd-colored vapors near industrial areas</li>
  <li>Burning eyes, throat irritation, or coughing</li>
  <li>Emergency sirens or alerts from officials</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you notice these signs, act immediately—don’t wait for perfect confirmation.
</p>

<h2>2. First Decision: Shelter or Evacuate?</h2>

<p>
  Chemical spills are one of the few emergencies where authorities clearly say which option is safer. The rule is simple:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If the cloud is moving toward you → evacuate immediately.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>If the cloud has already passed you or is nearby → shelter in place.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
  Evacuating through the plume is the most dangerous mistake people make.
</p>

<p>
  For safer route planning during any evacuation, review 
  <a href="evacuation-route-planning.html">Evacuation Route Planning</a>.
</p>

<h2>3. How to Shelter Indoors Effectively</h2>

<p>
  Sheltering isn't just “stay inside and hope.” You have to seal your home fast:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Close and lock all windows and doors</li>
  <li>Turn off HVAC, swamp coolers, fans, and anything pulling outside air in</li>
  <li>Seal gaps with towels, tape, or plastic sheeting</li>
  <li>Move to an interior room with the fewest openings</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Swamp coolers are a major vulnerability in the Southwest—turn them off immediately. They pull outside air directly in.
</p>

<h2>4. If You Must Evacuate</h2>

<p>
  Leave quickly and drive perpendicular to the plume’s direction, not directly away from it. This moves you out of exposure 
  faster. Keep windows closed, HVAC set to “recirculate,” and avoid low-lying routes where heavier gases can settle.
</p>

<h2>5. Protecting Your Airways</h2>

<p>
  Most homeowners don’t own real respirators, but simple steps reduce inhalation:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use an N95 or KN95 mask if available</li>
  <li>Cover nose/mouth with a damp cloth if nothing else exists</li>
  <li>Avoid running or heavy breathing outdoors</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This doesn’t make toxic gases “safe”—it reduces the immediate harm while you get to better conditions.
</p>

<h2>6. Pets and Animals</h2>

<p>
  Pets breathe the same air you do, but much faster relative to their size. Bring them indoors immediately. Don’t let them 
  walk across contaminated dirt or puddles—chemical residues can burn paws or cause sickness if they lick themselves.
</p>

<h2>7. After the Spill: Reentry and Cleaning</h2>

<p>
  Do not ventilate your home until authorities say the air is clear. Then:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open windows on opposite sides to flush air</li>
  <li>Run fans only after outside air is safe</li>
  <li>Wash exposed surfaces with soap and water</li>
</ul>

<p>

  <a href="after-disaster-reentry-basics.html">After-Disaster Reentry Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>8. What to Add to Your Chemical Emergency Kit</h2>

<ul>
  <li>N95/KN95 masks</li>
  <li>Duct tape + plastic sheeting</li>
  <li>Battery-powered radio</li>
  <li>Extra water (chemical events often require shutoff)</li>
  <li>Printed emergency contacts</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Chemical spills are high-risk events, but the decisions and actions above cut your exposure dramatically.

<h1>Hurricane Preparedness Basics: Protecting Your Home Before the Storm</h1>

<p>
  Hurricanes give warnings, but people still wait too long. By the time the forecast becomes “serious,” stores are empty,
  roads are clogged, and your window to secure the home is shrinking fast. This guide covers the steps that actually
  matter—hardening your house, preparing supplies, and knowing when to evacuate.
</p>

<p>
  If you need a full list of baseline supplies before diving into storm-specific prep, start with the
  <a href="basic-home-emergency-kit-list.html">Basic Home Emergency Kit List</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. Know Your Zone and Evacuation Routes</h2>

<p>
  Hurricanes hit regions differently based on elevation, flood zones, and distance from the coast. Your first job is simple:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify your official evacuation zone</li>
  <li>Know two ways out if one route floods</li>
  <li>Decide your destination before the storm is close</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you don’t already have one, build your evacuation details into your
  <a href="go-bag-checklist.html">go-bag</a> and your
  <a href="short-term-evacuation-prep.html">Short-Term Evacuation Prep</a> plan.
</p>

<h2>2. Secure Doors, Windows, and Exterior Openings</h2>

<p>
  Flying debris is the top cause of broken windows, which leads to pressure changes that can rip roofs off. Minimal prep:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Install hurricane shutters or pre-cut plywood for every window</li>
  <li>Reinforce sliding glass doors with a bar or brace</li>
  <li>Seal gaps around doors to reduce water intrusion</li>
  <li>Close and lock all windows—even small ones</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Skip the duct tape myth. It doesn’t stop breaking—it just makes the cleanup worse.
</p>

<h2>3. Protect the Yard Before It Becomes a Missile Field</h2>

<p>
  Anything that isn’t anchored becomes a projectile during high winds. That includes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trash bins</li>
  <li>Outdoor furniture</li>
  <li>Grill accessories</li>
  <li>Yard tools and loose lumber</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Put it all inside the house or garage—sheds and carports often fail first.
</p>

<h2>4. Prepare for Power Loss</h2>

<p>
  Hurricanes routinely knock out power for days or weeks. Basics:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Charge all devices and battery packs early</li>
  <li>Have flashlights and headlamps for every person</li>
  <li>Use coolers to reduce fridge door openings</li>
  <li>Have backup cooking methods that are safe outdoors</li>
</ul>

  <a href="power-outage-prep-basics.html">Power Outage Prep Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>5. Water and Food Storage</h2>

<p>
  Water systems often fail or become contaminated after major storms. Stock:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>At least 1 gallon per person per day for several days</li>
  <li>Simple, shelf-stable meals</li>
</ul>

<p>

  <a href="water-storage-basics.html">Water Storage Basics</a> and  
  <a href="non-perishable-food-basics.html">Non-Perishable Food Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>6. Fuel, Vehicles, and Backup Power</h2>

<p>
  Fuel shortages happen ahead of every storm. Don’t wait:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fill your vehicle early</li>
  <li>Top off propane or generator fuel</li>
  <li>Test the generator before the storm, not during it</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For proper storage rules and safety, see  
  <a href="fuel-storage-safety-basics.html">Fuel Storage Safety Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>7. Medical and Special Needs Preparation</h2>

<p>
  Pharmacies close, supplies run out, and emergency services are overwhelmed. Make sure you have:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ample prescription medications</li>
  <li>A stocked home first aid kit</li>
  <li>Backup devices or batteries for medical equipment</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2>8. When to Evacuate</h2>

<p>
  The most dangerous mistake people make is waiting for the storm to “look worse.” Don’t gamble with storm surge or
  flooded roads. Leave when:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your zone is under an evacuation order</li>
  <li>You live in a manufactured home or older structure</li>
  <li>You’re in a coastal, low-lying, or surge-prone area</li>
  <li>You need electricity for medical devices</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Once winds reach tropical storm strength, it’s too late—fire, EMS, and police won’t respond, and roads become a
  demolition derby.
</p>

<h2>9. The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  Hurricanes reward early movers and punish procrastinators. Secure your home, stock supplies before everyone else
  panics, and evacuate when you’re told. A few hours of prep on a calm day beats days of chaos when the storm is already
  at your doorstep.

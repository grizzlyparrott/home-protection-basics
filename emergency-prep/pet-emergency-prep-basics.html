<h1>Pet Emergency Prep Basics: Keeping Animals Safe During Disasters</h1>

<p>
  Pets rely completely on you during emergencies. Power outages, evacuations, shelter-in-place orders, and chemical
  spills hit them just as hard as humans—except they can’t pack, plan, or understand what’s happening. This guide shows
  exactly what to prepare so your animals stay fed, safe, and accounted for when conditions get bad.
</p>

<p>
  If you’re building out your broader evacuation setup, pair this with the  
  <a href="go-bag-checklist.html">Go-Bag Checklist</a> and  
  <a href="short-term-evacuation-prep.html">Short-Term Evacuation Prep</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. Food and Water Supplies</h2>

<p>
  Pets need their own emergency stash—not a “they can share ours” plan. Stock:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>3–7 days of pet food (more if storms or outages are common in your region)</li>
  <li>Extra water specifically for pets</li>
  <li>Portable bowls or collapsible containers</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Store all of it in airtight containers to keep pests and moisture out.
</p>

<h2>2. Identification and Records</h2>

<p>
  Pets get lost during evacuations, storms, and chaotic movement. Your job is to make them easy to identify:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collar with up-to-date tags</li>
  <li>Microchip with current contact information</li>
  <li>Printed vaccination and medical records</li>
  <li>Recent photo of you with your pet (proves ownership if needed)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Keep documentation in a waterproof pouch with your own emergency papers.
</p>

<h2>3. Medications and Special Needs</h2>

<p>
  Pets with chronic conditions or ongoing treatments need the same medication planning that humans do. Pack:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Extra doses of any prescribed medications</li>
  <li>Flea/tick preventatives</li>
  <li>Any special dietary items</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For guidance on human medication planning, see  
  <a href="medication-management-during-emergencies.html">Medication Management During Emergencies</a>.
</p>

<h2>4. Carriers, Leashes, and Transport</h2>

<p>
  Evacuations become chaos if pets aren’t secured. You need:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sturdy pet carriers for cats, small dogs, or small animals</li>
  <li>Leashes and harnesses for larger pets</li>
  <li>Spare leashes in case one breaks</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Carriers should be near your go-bag—not buried in a garage. Fast access matters.
</p>

<h2>5. Comfort Items</h2>

<p>
  Emergencies are stressful for pets. Simple comfort items help them stay calm:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Favorite toy or blanket</li>
  <li>Treats</li>
  <li>Portable litter tray or waste bags</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These items reduce panic, barking, and escape attempts during evacuations.
</p>

<h2>6. Shelter Considerations</h2>

<p>
  Not all shelters accept pets. Before emergencies hit, know:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which local shelters or hotels accept animals</li>
  <li>Which friends or family can temporarily house your pets</li>
  <li>Your backup plan if roads close earlier than expected</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Never assume you can “figure it out when we get there.” Pet-friendly shelters fill up fast.
</p>

<h2>7. Outdoor and Large Animals</h2>

<p>
  If you have livestock, outdoor dogs, or other large animals, your prep needs to scale:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pre-identified evacuation routes for trailers</li>
  <li>Temporary shelter options</li>
  <li>Feed stored in weather-protected bins</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Large animals often require earlier evacuation to avoid traffic, flooding, or road closures.
</p>

<h2>8. The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  Pets don’t understand emergencies, but they feel every bit of the danger. Preparing food, documents, medications,
  carriers, and shelter plans ahead of time ensures they’re not the first casualties of a disaster. Treat pet prep as
  part of your main emergency workflow—not an afterthought.

<h1>Earthquake Preparedness Basics: What Homeowners Actually Need to Do</h1>

<p>
  Earthquakes hit without warning, and the first few seconds determine whether you’re injured by falling objects, glass,
  or collapsing shelves. This guide focuses on simple, effective steps that reduce your risk before, during, and immediately 
  after shaking.
</p>

<p>
  For a full list of general emergency kit items, see 
  <a href="basic-home-emergency-kit-list.html">Basic Home Emergency Kit List</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. Secure the Dangerous Stuff Before It Falls</h2>

<p>
  Most earthquake injuries come from non-structural hazards—objects inside the home that move violently when the shaking
  starts. Secure these items now:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bookshelves and tall cabinets: anchor to studs with L-brackets</li>
  <li>TVs and monitors: strap or wall-mount</li>
  <li>Water heaters: use earthquake straps</li>
  <li>Heavy wall decor: use quake hooks, not small nails</li>
  <li>Breakables: store lower or inside latched cabinets</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Anything heavy above shoulder height becomes a missile during a quake.
</p>

<h2>2. Create Safe Zones in Each Room</h2>

<p>
  Safe zones are areas free of falling hazards where you can quickly drop, cover, and hold on. Examples include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Under sturdy desks or tables</li>
  <li>Beside interior walls away from windows</li>
  <li>Next to heavy furniture that won’t tip</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Avoid bathrooms with mirrors, kitchens with loose items, or rooms with large windows.
</p>

<h2>3. Know What to Do When Shaking Begins</h2>

<p>
  The correct response during an earthquake is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Drop</strong> to your hands and knees</li>
  <li><strong>Cover</strong> under sturdy furniture or with your arms over your head</li>
  <li><strong>Hold on</strong> until the shaking stops</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Do not run outside. Most injuries happen during attempts to move to a different room or exit.
</p>

<h2>4. Shut Off Utilities Only If Damaged</h2>

<p>
  After shaking stops, check for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gas smell or hissing</li>
  <li>Visible fire or sparks</li>
  <li>Broken water lines</li>
  <li>Damaged electrical panels</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you suspect a gas leak, shut off the gas valve and evacuate immediately. Never turn the gas back on yourself.

  <a href="after-disaster-reentry-basics.html">After-Disaster Reentry Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>5. Plan for Aftershocks</h2>

<p>
  Aftershocks can be as strong as the main quake. Treat each one the same way—drop, cover, and hold on. Avoid damaged
  structures, chimneys, and unsecured items until a full inspection is done.
</p>

<h2>6. Build an Earthquake-Ready Kit</h2>

<p>
  Your home kit should include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sturdy shoes near every bed</li>
  <li>Work gloves</li>
  <li>Flashlight and extra batteries</li>
  <li>Whistle for signaling</li>
  <li>Dust mask or N95</li>
  <li>Small pry bar</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For lighting backups, see 
  <a href="backup-lighting-options.html">Backup Lighting Options</a>.
</p>

<h2>7. Evaluate Your Home’s Structural Risks</h2>

<p>
  Older homes—especially unreinforced masonry or cripple-wall homes—are more vulnerable. If you live in an area prone to
  earthquakes, consider:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seismic retrofitting</li>
  <li>Bolting the structure to the foundation</li>
  <li>Strengthening weak walls</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These upgrades dramatically reduce collapse risk and insurance headaches later.
</p>

<h2>8. Family Communication and Meeting Points</h2>

<p>
  Earthquakes often knock out cell towers and power immediately. Your family should know:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where to meet outside the home</li>
  <li>Where to meet outside the neighborhood</li>
  <li>Who to contact out of state as a “check-in” person</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Build your plan with the help of 
  <a href="family-communication-plan-basics.html">Family Communication Plan Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>9. Don’t Forget Your Car</h2>

<p>
  Roads may be blocked with debris or damaged. Keep your car’s gas tank at least half full so you can leave if needed.
  For what your vehicle should carry, see 
  <a href="car-emergency-kit-basics.html">Car Emergency Kit Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>10. The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  Earthquake safety is mostly about preparation before the shaking starts. Securing furniture, identifying safe zones, 
  keeping essential supplies, and knowing the correct response cut your risk dramatically and make recovery faster.

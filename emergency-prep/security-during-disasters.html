<h1>Security During Disasters: Keeping Your Home and Family Protected</h1>

<p>
  Disasters don’t just damage property—they create openings for opportunistic crime. Power goes out, alarms stop
  working, police response slows, and some people take advantage of the chaos. This guide explains the practical,
  non-paranoid steps that keep your home secure during emergencies.
</p>

<p>
  For broader decisions about whether to stay or leave, read  
  <a href="bug-in-vs-bug-out-basics.html">Bug-In vs. Bug-Out Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. Understand How Crime Changes During Disasters</h2>

<p>
  Most people panic about the wrong things. The real risks rise when:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Neighborhoods go dark during long outages</li>
  <li>Evacuations leave homes unattended</li>
  <li>Storm debris hides break-in activity</li>
  <li>Law enforcement is stretched thin</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Disaster crime is usually opportunistic, not organized. Your job is to make your home the “hard target” on the street.
</p>

<h2>2. Reinforce the Basics Before Anything Happens</h2>

<p>
  The simplest upgrades give you the biggest advantage:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solid-core exterior doors</li>
  <li>Upgraded deadbolts and strike plates</li>
  <li>Window locks and security film</li>
  <li>Motion-activated lighting</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you haven't already handled the lighting side, see  
  <a href="/home-security/security-lighting-basics.html">Security Lighting Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>3. Keep Your Home Looking Occupied</h2>

<p>
  Even during disasters, appearance matters. Burglars prefer empty homes. Simple tricks:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leave interior lights on a battery-powered timer</li>
  <li>Keep curtains in their usual positions</li>
  <li>Ask neighbors to keep an eye out if you're forced to leave</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you evacuate, don’t broadcast it online—or mention it to anyone who doesn’t need to know.
</p>

<h2>4. Secure the Perimeter</h2>

<p>
  During storms and outages, people walk into yards “just checking damage.” Some aren’t innocent. Do this early:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lock all gates and outbuildings</li>
  <li>Remove ladders, tools, or items people could use to break in</li>
  <li>Clear sightlines where possible</li>
</ul>

<p>
  A locked yard doesn’t stop everyone, but it slows them and makes noise—exactly what you want.
</p>

<h2>5. Protect Valuables Inside</h2>

<p>
  Assume someone may get inside. Prepare accordingly:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a bolted-down safe for documents and valuables</li>
  <li>Move electronics away from windows</li>
  <li>Keep emergency cash stored securely</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you haven't protected your important paperwork yet, read  
  <a href="protecting-important-documents-at-home.html">Protecting Important Documents at Home</a>.
</p>

<h2>6. Alarm Systems During Outages</h2>

<p>
  Modern systems with battery backup still work for hours, sometimes a day or more. But:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hardwired systems may fail without power</li>
  <li>Internet-dependent systems may go down</li>
  <li>Cellular backup is far more reliable during outages</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Even a basic siren is valuable—it scares away most opportunists.
</p>

<h2>7. Security During Evacuation</h2>

<p>
  If you must evacuate:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lock every door and window</li>
  <li>Cover windows if you have time</li>
  <li>Shut off water and gas</li>
  <li>Hide valuables in the safest part of the home</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Bring your go-bag, medications, and essential documents. See  
  <a href="short-term-evacuation-prep.html">Short-Term Evacuation Prep</a>  
  for specifics.
</p>

<h2>8. Neighborhood Coordination</h2>

<p>
  A connected neighborhood is far safer than isolated homes. Coordinate:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check-ins during long outages</li>
  <li>Shared watching of each other’s property</li>
  <li>Information sharing about suspicious activity</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you don’t already have a system, start with  
  <a href="neighborhood-coordination-basics.html">Neighborhood Coordination Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>9. The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  Disaster security isn’t complicated: make your home harder to enter, harder to approach unnoticed, and less attractive
  to opportunistic crime. Prepare before the event, keep things locked down during the chaos, and rely on neighbors when
  communication systems fall apart.

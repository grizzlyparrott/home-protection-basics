<h1>Crime Prevention Through Design: Shaping Your Property to Deter Intruders</h1>

<p>
  Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) sounds academic, but it’s just common sense:
  design your property so intruders feel exposed, controlled, and out of place.  
  When done right, your home becomes harder to approach and easier to defend—using nothing more
  than layout, visibility, and natural cues.
</p>

<p>
  If you haven’t already secured your yard’s perimeter, start with  
  <a href="../home-security/perimeter-security-fundamentals.html">Perimeter Security Fundamentals</a>  
  since CPTED works best when layered on top of a stable outer boundary.
</p>

<h2>1. Natural Surveillance: Make Intruders Visible</h2>

<p>
  Intruders rely on concealment. Remove it, and you remove most of the opportunity.  
  Natural surveillance means designing your yard so you can see movement without obstruction.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trim shrubs below 3 feet</li>
  <li>Raise tree canopies to at least 6–7 feet</li>
  <li>Remove tall, dense plants near doors and windows</li>
  <li>Keep fence lines clear of stacked items</li>
  <li>Add consistent dusk-to-dawn lighting</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If dark corners remain even after trimming, compare  
  <a href="../home-security/motion-light-vs-dusk-to-dawn.html">Motion vs Dusk-to-Dawn Lighting</a>  
  to fill those gaps.
</p>

<h2>2. Natural Access Control: Guide Movement Deliberately</h2>

<p>
  Access control means shaping where people are expected to walk—and making it obvious when someone
  is somewhere they shouldn’t be.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use clear, direct pathways to doors</li>
  <li>Use gates or landscaping to block side routes</li>
  <li>Separate private zones with small fence sections or hardscape</li>
  <li>Keep gates locked and visible from the house</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Side yard and driveway access often signal vulnerability.  
  If those areas are weak, review  
  <a href="../home-security/safe-parking-security-basics.html">Safe Parking Security Basics</a>.
</p>

<h2>3. Territorial Reinforcement: Show That the Property Is “Owned”</h2>

<p>
  Criminals avoid homes that look actively maintained and defended.  
  Territorial cues tell people, “This place is watched.”
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use clean, maintained landscaping</li>
  <li>Keep pathways swept and free of clutter</li>
  <li>Add clear house numbers visible day and night</li>
  <li>Install simple signage (no need for “military level security” nonsense)</li>
  <li>Prevent porch clutter that makes your home look ignored</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Homes that look lived in and cared for are statistically targeted far less often.
</p>

<h2>4. Space Management: Maintain Visibility Over Time</h2>

<p>
  CPTED isn’t a one-time project. It requires upkeep.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trim vegetation every season</li>
  <li>Check lighting monthly</li>
  <li>Remove objects that drift into fence lines</li>
  <li>Clear debris that creates hiding spots</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Camera and Sensor Placement With CPTED in Mind</h2>

<p>
  Cameras aren’t CPTED, but they fit perfectly into the layered model.
  Their job is to reinforce the feeling of exposure and reduce blind approaches.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cover each approach route to your home</li>
  <li>Keep sightlines clean—no bushes blocking views</li>
  <li>Pair cameras with lighting, not against it</li>
  <li>Create overlapping angles at gates and doors</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you haven’t already mapped out your blind spots, use the  
  <a href="../home-security/spotting-surveillance-blind-zones.html">Surveillance Blind Zone Guide</a>.
</p>

<h2>6. Quick CPTED Checklist</h2>

<ul>
  <li>No hiding spots near doors or windows</li>
  <li>Strong visibility across the yard</li>
  <li>Defined walkways and controlled access routes</li>
  <li>Active territorial cues (maintenance, visibility, lighting)</li>
  <li>Consistent upkeep to preserve sightlines</li>
  <li>Cameras reinforcing exposure and approach control</li>
</ul>

<p>
  CPTED turns your home from an “easy opportunity” into an undesirable target.
  When your design makes intruders feel watched, exposed, and out of place, they move on.

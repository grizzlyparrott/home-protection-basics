    <h1>Night Vision Performance Basics: How to Make Cameras Actually Work in the Dark</h1>

    <p>
      Most security footage fails at night.  
      Faces wash out, IR glare blinds the camera, backgrounds turn into black voids, and motion becomes blurry.
      None of this is random. It’s how infrared illumination and cheap sensors behave when installed incorrectly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before tweaking anything, review  
      <a href="/home-security/camera-placement-guide.html">Camera Placement Guide</a>.  
      Even a great camera performs terribly if mounted wrong.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Understand How IR Night Vision Works</h2>

    <p>
      Infrared night vision uses LEDs surrounding the lens.  
      These LEDs flood the scene with invisible light. The sensor then picks it up and converts it into a grayscale image.
      Problems start when the IR light hits something too close or too reflective.
    </p>

    <h3>IR Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>IR reflects off siding, glass, and metal.</li>
      <li>IR bounces off raindrops, fog, and dirty camera domes.</li>
      <li>IR weakens dramatically with distance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your camera is mounted where IR bounces back into the lens, your night image will always be garbage.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Mount Cameras Away From Walls and Eaves</h2>

    <p>
      The number one cause of blown-out night footage is mounting the camera too close to a reflective surface.
    </p>

    <h3>Avoid These Mistakes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mounting under an eave where IR hits the overhang.</li>
      <li>Mounting tight against siding.</li>
      <li>Mounting near downspouts or metal trim.</li>
      <li>Pointing through a window (IR reflects straight back into the lens).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Give the IR light space to disperse—at least 8–12 inches from reflective surfaces.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Distance Matters More Than Resolution</h2>

    <p>
      You want the IR beam to reach the subject with enough strength to capture detail, without overwhelming the sensor.
    </p>

    <h3>General Night Vision Distances</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Budget cameras:</strong> 15–25 feet of usable IR.</li>
      <li><strong>Good mid-range cameras:</strong> 30–50 feet.</li>
      <li><strong>High-end PoE cameras:</strong> 80–130 feet.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your camera claims “130 feet of IR,” assume half of that is actually clear detail.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Avoid Hot Spots and Overexposure</h2>

    <p>
      Hot spots occur when IR light hits an object very close to the camera—your porch railing, a wall, a plant, or even a decorative post.
    </p>

    <h3>Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Trim plants and branches within 3–6 feet of the camera.</li>
      <li>Angle the camera slightly away from railings or posts.</li>
      <li>Mount higher or farther from obstacles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Clean the Lens and Dome Regularly</h2>

    <p>
      Dust, pollen, spider webs, and moisture droplets scatter IR light.  
      This creates snowy, hazy night images even with good hardware.
    </p>

    <h3>Routine Maintenance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Wipe the lens with a microfiber cloth monthly.</li>
      <li>Remove webs and nests from around the camera housing.</li>
      <li>Clean domes more often if you live in dusty or humid areas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Choose Cameras With Strong Night Sensors</h2>

    <p>
      Sensor quality matters more than resolution.  
      A cheap 4K camera may perform worse at night than a high-quality 1080p sensor with better dynamic range.
    </p>

    <h3>Look For</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Starlight sensors</strong> (better low-light performance).</li>
      <li><strong>Wide dynamic range (WDR)</strong> for mixed lighting environments.</li>
      <li><strong>High IR LED output</strong> without excessive hotspotting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Consider Supplemental Lighting</h2>

    <p>
      IR isn’t the only option.  
      Visible white-light motion lighting dramatically improves image clarity and color night vision.
    </p>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear color footage instead of grayscale.</li>
      <li>Better facial identification.</li>
      <li>Acts as a deterrent when activated.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A cheap motion floodlight will outperform the IR LEDs on almost every consumer-grade camera.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Test at Night Before Final Mounting</h2>

    <p>
      What looks perfect during the day may fail at night.  
      Always test placement after sunset before locking in the screws.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Walk the approach and check face clarity.</li>
      <li>Look for glare, reflection, and hot spots.</li>
      <li>Adjust angle and distance until the image is clean.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once you dial it in, your night footage will actually be useful—not just a blurry silhouette.

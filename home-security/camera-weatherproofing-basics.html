    <h1>Camera Weatherproofing Basics: Keeping Outdoor Cameras Alive Long-Term</h1>

    <p>
      Outdoor cameras live in rain, dust, heat, cold, and wind. If you mount them like indoor gadgets, they die early,
      fog up, or leak—usually right before you actually need footage. Weatherproofing isn’t complicated, but you have to
      respect the environment you’re putting the camera in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before worrying about weather, make sure the camera is in the right place at all. Read the
      <a href="/home-security/camera-placement-guide.html">Security Camera Placement Guide</a>
      and the
      <a href="/home-security/indoor-vs-outdoor-security-cameras.html">Indoor vs Outdoor Cameras Overview</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Understand IP Ratings (What “Weatherproof” Really Means)</h2>

    <p>
      “Weather resistant” on the box doesn’t mean much. The IP rating tells you how tough the camera actually is.
    </p>

    <h3>Basic IP Rating Breakdown</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>IP65:</strong> Dust-tight, protected against water jets from one direction. OK for sheltered mounting.</li>
      <li><strong>IP66:</strong> Dust-tight, protected against powerful water jets. Better for exposed walls.</li>
      <li><strong>IP67:</strong> Dust-tight, can handle temporary immersion. Strong protection in heavy rain.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If a camera doesn’t list an IP rating, assume it’s not meant for real weather exposure. Use those only under
      solid cover or indoors.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Mount Under Cover When You Can</h2>

    <p>
      Even a fully weather-rated camera lasts longer if you keep it out of direct abuse.
    </p>

    <h3>Best Mounting Spots</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Under soffits or eaves, <strong>without</strong> pushing the lens right against the overhang.</li>
      <li>On vertical walls with at least partial protection from wind and sideways rain.</li>
      <li>Under porch ceilings or awnings for entry cameras.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Don’t jam the camera tight up into the corner of the eave. That traps heat, messes up night vision, and catches
      more cobwebs. Give it a few inches of breathing room and follow the angle rules from the
      <a href="/home-security/camera-placement-guide.html">placement guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Seal Wall Penetrations and Cable Routes</h2>

    <p>
      Water doesn’t have to get inside the camera to cause problems. If it runs along the cable into your wall, you
      get rot, corrosion, and sometimes interior leaks.
    </p>

    <h3>Do This Every Time You Drill a Hole</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Drill a hole just big enough for the cable or conduit.</li>
      <li>Run the cable with a <strong>drip loop</strong> (cable dips below the hole, then back up).</li>
      <li>Seal the opening with exterior-grade silicone or appropriate sealant.</li>
      <li>Use grommets or bushings so the cable jacket isn’t cut by sharp edges.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The drip loop matters—water should drop off the cable before it reaches the wall penetration.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Protect Connectors and Junctions</h2>

    <p>
      On wired or PoE cameras, the most common failure point isn’t the camera—it’s the connector. Moisture corrodes
      RJ45 plugs, barrel connectors, and cheap couplers quickly.
    </p>

    <h3>Connector Protection Basics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep all network and power connections inside a junction box or indoors when possible.</li>
      <li>Use weatherproof junction boxes with gasketed lids.</li>
      <li>Don’t leave cable couplers hanging behind the camera in open air.</li>
      <li>Use rated outdoor cable and connectors, not generic interior parts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you can see bare connectors exposed behind the camera, you already have a future failure sitting on the wall.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Deal With Heat and Direct Sun</h2>

    <p>
      Heat kills electronics faster than cold. Direct sun on a dark camera housing can push temperatures way past what
      the spec sheet says.
    </p>

    <h3>Heat Management Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid mounting on dark, south-facing walls if you live in hot climates.</li>
      <li>Prefer shaded, ventilated spots when possible.</li>
      <li>Don’t enclose the camera in tight decorative housings that trap heat.</li>
      <li>Check during summer: touch the housing—if it’s painfully hot, that’s rough on the internals.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you live somewhere that cooks in summer, favor cameras rated for higher operating temps and consider lighter
      housings that reflect rather than absorb heat.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Handle Cold, Snow, and Ice</h2>

    <p>
      Cold itself usually isn’t the main problem—it’s condensation and ice buildup.
    </p>

    <h3>Cold-Weather Basics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure the camera is rated for your winter lows.</li>
      <li>Avoid pointing straight up where snow and sleet can pack onto the housing.</li>
      <li>Mount so snow sliding off roofs doesn’t slam into the camera.</li>
      <li>Check for ice forming over the lens or IR LEDs after storms.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If a camera frequently fogs on the inside, that means moisture got into the housing at some point. That’s a
      warranty or replacement situation more than a “wipe it off” problem.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Control Moisture, Fogging, and Condensation</h2>

    <p>
      Fogged lenses and hazy domes ruin footage, especially at night when IR hits the moisture layer and blows out the
      image.
    </p>

    <h3>Prevention and Maintenance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Install cameras with intact gaskets and seals—don’t pinch or tear them during mounting.</li>
      <li>Use the supplied weather caps or boots on cable exits if the manufacturer includes them.</li>
      <li>Keep a microfiber cloth for regular cleaning, especially after storms.</li>
      <li>For domes, clean off pollen, dust, and salt spray regularly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For how this ties into night image quality, see
      <a href="/home-security/night-vision-performance-basics.html">Night Vision Performance Basics</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Don’t Let “Weather Protection” Break Your Image</h2>

    <p>
      Overdoing covers and shields can cause more issues than they solve—glare, IR bounce, and shadows that create blind
      spots.
    </p>

    <h3>Watch for These Problems</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Homemade “hoods” that block part of the field of view.</li>
      <li>Plastic covers that fog or scratch and blur the image.</li>
      <li>IR reflecting off nearby overhangs or shields at night.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Any visor or cover you add should be minimal and tested at night. If you see halos, glare, or blown-out areas,
      rethink the shield or adjust the angle. Combine this with
      <a href="/home-security/avoiding-camera-blind-spots.html">Avoiding Camera Blind Spots</a>
      so you don’t create new problems while trying to protect the camera.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Use Hardware Meant for Outdoors</h2>

    <p>
      Mounting hardware matters. Rusted fasteners and flimsy anchors let cameras shift, sag, or fall.
    </p>

    <h3>Use the Right Materials</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Exterior-rated screws and anchors sized correctly for your siding or masonry.</li>
      <li>Stainless or coated hardware to resist corrosion.</li>
      <li>Solid backing where possible—don’t rely on thin siding alone.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you’re running wired or PoE cameras, match your weatherproofing with the guidance in
      <a href="/home-security/wired-vs-wireless-cameras.html">Wired vs Wireless Cameras</a>
      so the whole system—not just the housing—holds up outdoors.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Simple Maintenance Schedule</h2>

    <p>
      Weatherproofing isn’t “set it and forget it.” A quick, regular check keeps everything working.
    </p>

    <h3>Every 3–6 Months, Do This:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Inspect housings, seals, and cable entries for cracks or gaps.</li>
      <li>Clean lenses and domes with a soft cloth.</li>
      <li>Check junction boxes and connectors for corrosion or water intrusion.</li>
      <li>Review a night recording for each camera to confirm image quality is still good.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Do those basics and your “weatherproof” cameras actually stay weatherproof.  
      Ignore them, and you’ll find out they failed the first time you really need footage.

    <h1>Perimeter Security Fundamentals: Securing the Outer Layer First</h1>

    <p>
      If your perimeter is weak, everything else becomes harder—doors, lights, cameras, and alarms all work better
      when an intruder never makes it close enough to test them.  
      This guide breaks down the basics of building a strong, layered perimeter so strangers cannot approach your
      home without being noticed or slowed down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before tightening the perimeter, check your yard for overlooked approach routes using the  
      <a href="../home-security/spotting-surveillance-blind-zones.html">Surveillance Blind Zone Guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Understand How Intruders Approach Homes</h2>

    <p>
      Most intruders avoid direct approaches and instead follow predictable patterns:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Side yard access between houses</li>
      <li>Backyard approaches hidden from the street</li>
      <li>Low-visibility corners created by fences and landscaping</li>
      <li>Utility easements, alleys, or walking paths behind properties</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you have a pool or large backyard area, securing those routes is critical—see  
      <a href="../home-security/securing-pool-areas.html">Securing Pool Areas</a>  
      for details on tightening those zones.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Fence Strength and Structure</h2>

    <p>
      Most fences are built for privacy, not security. Strengthen the basics:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Height:</strong> 6 feet or taller is ideal.</li>
      <li><strong>Visibility gaps:</strong> trim vegetation that creates hiding spots.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> use long screws, reinforced hinges, and secure latch hardware.</li>
      <li><strong>Materials:</strong> composite and metal outperform old wood panels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Gate Security (Your Real Weak Point)</h2>

    <p>
      Gates are almost always the easiest point of entry. A strong fence with a weak gate is pointless.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Add a <strong>secondary locking mechanism</strong> (padlock or keyed latch).</li>
      <li>Ensure hinges cannot be lifted or removed.</li>
      <li>Use long screws into framing, not just thin posts.</li>
      <li>Remove climbable objects near the gate.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      If your property layout channels intruders toward the gate, consider reinforcing the nearby  
      <a href="../home-security/reinforcing-garage-interior-door.html">garage interior door</a>  
      as another protective layer.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Lighting the Perimeter Correctly</h2>

    <p>
      Lighting is one of the strongest deterrents—but only if positioned correctly:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use <strong>dusk-to-dawn lighting</strong> for wide coverage along fence lines.</li>
      <li>Add <strong>motion lights</strong> at gates and path entries.</li>
      <li>Avoid aiming lights directly at cameras to prevent glare.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For a deeper comparison of lighting types, check the  
      <a href="../home-security/motion-light-vs-dusk-to-dawn.html">Motion vs Dusk-to-Dawn Guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Camera Placement Along the Yard Perimeter</h2>

    <p>
      You don’t need a camera on every fence post. You just need good coverage on the approaches intruders actually use.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cover each gate and main access point.</li>
      <li>Angle cameras down fence lines for maximum visibility.</li>
      <li>Create overlapping fields of view at key chokepoints.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you're seeing dark corners or coverage gaps, use the  
      <a href="../home-security/avoiding-camera-blind-spots.html">Avoiding Camera Blind Spots</a>  
      article to clean up those issues.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Landscaping That Works for Security</h2>

    <p>
      The wrong plants create concealment; the right plants remove it.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Keep shrubs under 3 feet tall near fences.</li>
      <li>Trim trees to eliminate branches that act as climbing aids.</li>
      <li>Use thorny bushes near vulnerable spots as a natural deterrent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Quick Perimeter Security Checklist</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Fence is structurally sound and not climbable.</li>
      <li>Gate has strong hardware and a secondary lock.</li>
      <li>Perimeter lighting covers paths, corners, and gates.</li>
      <li>Cameras monitor approach routes, not just open areas.</li>
      <li>Landscaping does not create hiding or climbing opportunities.</li>
      <li>No tools or climbable objects stored near the fence line.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A strong perimeter forces intruders to either give up or take risks you will notice.  
      Secure the outer layer first, and everything inside becomes far easier to protect.

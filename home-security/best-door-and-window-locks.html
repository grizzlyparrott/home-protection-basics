    <h1>Best Door and Window Locks: What Actually Improves Home Security</h1>

    <p>
      Locks don’t stop forced entry on their own. What stops it is the strength of the lock combined with the strength of the
      door, frame, and hardware supporting it. Most break-ins rely on kicking or prying, not picking, so the goal is simple:
      reinforce the entry points so they don’t fail under basic pressure. This guide explains the lock types and hardware that
      provide real gains in security without unnecessary complexity.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Deadbolts: The Primary Lock for Exterior Doors</h2>
    <p>
      A solid deadbolt is the main locking mechanism for any exterior door. The bolt should fully extend into the frame and be
      supported by hardware that can resist force. The deadbolt matters more than the knob lock because it engages deeper into
      the door frame.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single-Cylinder Deadbolts:</strong> Standard deadbolt with a key outside and a thumb turn inside. Reliable and easy to use.</li>

      <li><strong>Double-Cylinder Deadbolts:</strong> Require a key on both sides. Useful near glass windows but less convenient in daily use.</li>

      <li><strong>High-Grade Bolts:</strong> ANSI Grade 1 or 2 deadbolts resist more force and use stronger internal components.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> On a typical wooden door, upgrading the deadbolt alone won’t stop a kick-in unless the bolt engages a reinforced strike plate anchored into the framing studs.</p>

    <h2>2. Strike Plates: Where Doors Usually Fail</h2>
    <p>
      The strike plate is the metal piece on the door frame where the deadbolt locks in. Most standard strike plates use short screws
      that only bite into the trim—not the actual framing. This is the most common failure point during forced entry.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reinforced Strike Plates:</strong> Larger plates with more screw points spread impact across a wider section of the frame.</li>

      <li><strong>3-inch Screws:</strong> Screws long enough to reach the framing studs significantly increase resistance to force.</li>

      <li><strong>Heavy-Duty Kits:</strong> Some reinforcement kits stiffen both the frame and the door edge for balanced protection.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Replacing a flimsy two-screw strike plate with a four-screw reinforced plate can reduce door flex and prevent the frame from splitting during a kick attempt.</p>

    <h2>3. Door Construction: Hollow vs. Solid Core</h2>
    <p>
      The lock is only as strong as the door holding it. Many homes use hollow-core doors in places that should have solid-core or
      steel-reinforced doors. Weak door slabs can split under pressure regardless of lock quality.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hollow-Core Doors:</strong> Not suitable for exterior use. Easy to break under force.</li>

      <li><strong>Solid Wood or Engineered Core:</strong> Much stronger and better suited for supporting deadbolts.</li>

      <li><strong>Steel Doors:</strong> Offer stable structure and consistent performance under force.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Even with a Grade 1 deadbolt, a hollow-core door can fracture around the latch area with a single kick, bypassing the lock entirely.</p>

    <h2>4. Window Locks: Securing the Most Overlooked Entry Points</h2>
    <p>
      Windows are common entry points because their locks are often weak, worn, or never upgraded. A basic latch only keeps the
      window closed under normal conditions—it is not designed to resist force.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sash Locks (Double-Hung Windows):</strong> These prevent vertical movement and keep the two sashes locked together.</li>

      <li><strong>Sliding Window Bars:</strong> Reinforcement bars or dowels prevent horizontal sliding.</li>

      <li><strong>Track Pin Locks:</strong> Pins inserted into the track restrict sliding movement and increase resistance to prying.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A simple track pin can stop a sliding window from being forced open even if the factory latch fails under pressure.</p>

    <h2>5. Garage Door and Side Entry Doors</h2>
    <p>
      These doors are often weaker than the front or back doors. Side-entry garage doors, in particular, tend to have lightweight
      hardware and hollow slabs that don’t hold up well against force.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deadbolt on Side Doors:</strong> Many garage side doors only have knob locks. Adding a deadbolt strengthens the entry point.</li>

      <li><strong>Reinforced Frames:</strong> The frame on these doors is often thin and benefits from longer screws and stronger strike plates.</li>

      <li><strong>Interior Garage Door:</strong> This door should be treated like an exterior entry door since it leads into the home.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A side-entry garage door with only a knob lock can usually be forced open with shoulder pressure; adding a deadbolt and reinforced strike plate changes that completely.</p>

    <h2>Bottom Line: What Actually Improves Security</h2>
    <p>
      Most forced entry isn’t subtle. Intruders rely on speed and force, not complex lock manipulation. Strong locks matter, but the
      hardware that supports them matters even more.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use solid or reinforced doors on all exterior entries</li>
      <li>Install a quality deadbolt with a reinforced strike plate</li>
      <li>Use long screws that anchor hardware into framing studs</li>
      <li>Upgrade weak window latches on older windows</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      With these upgrades in place, the entry points resist common break-in methods effectively. Everything beyond this is convenience or aesthetics.

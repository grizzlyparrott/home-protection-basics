    <h1>Hardening Detached Structures: Securing Sheds, Garages, and Workshops</h1>

    <p>
      Detached structures are low-risk, high-reward targets for intruders. They sit away from the main house, often out of
      camera view, and usually contain expensive tools, bikes, equipment, or fuel. The mistake homeowners make is treating
      sheds and detached garages like storage—not like structures that need real security hardening.
    </p>

    <p>
      This guide covers the most common failure points and the simplest, highest-impact upgrades you can make. If you want
      perimeter-wide protection, pair this with 
      <a href="/home-security/securing-yard-gates.html">Securing Yard Gates</a> and 
      <a href="/home-security/identifying-vulnerable-fencing.html">Identifying Vulnerable Fencing</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Start With the Door: The #1 Break-In Point</h2>
    <p>
      Shed and garage doors are usually thin, hollow, or mounted with tiny screws. Intruders exploit this immediately.
    </p>

    <h3>Door Hardening Steps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Replace factory screws with <strong>3-inch exterior screws</strong> in hinges and strike plates.</li>
      <li>Add a <strong>door reinforcement plate</strong> to prevent kick-ins.</li>
      <li>Use a <strong>padlock hasp with concealed screws</strong> for sheds.</li>
      <li>Install a <strong>deadbolt</strong> on any garage door with a standard knob.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Homeowner Scenario A</h3>
    <p>
      Your wooden shed door has a decorative latch with ½-inch screws. An intruder can pry it off with a screwdriver in
      5–10 seconds. Adding a locking hasp with through-bolts stops the easy pry attack entirely.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Reinforce the Door Frame</h2>
    <p>
      A strong door means nothing if the frame is weak. On detached structures, the frame is almost always the actual weak
      point.
    </p>

    <h3>Frame Reinforcement Checklist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Install a metal strike plate reinforcement (same type used on residential doors).</li>
      <li>Add corner brackets to stiffen weak or splintered frames.</li>
      <li>Ensure the door fully seats into the frame—gaps invite prying.</li>
      <li>Check for rot or termite damage near the ground line.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Secure or Replace Weak Windows</h2>
    <p>
      Most shed windows are single-pane and can be opened with zero effort. Treat them as vulnerabilities unless hardened.
    </p>

    <h3>Window Security Options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Install <strong>security film</strong> to resist smashing.</li>
      <li>Add <strong>window bars</strong> or a protective grille (common for sheds).</li>
      <li>Use <strong>pin locks</strong> to secure sliding or swing-out windows.</li>
      <li>Apply <strong>frosted film</strong> so thieves can’t see what’s inside.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Homeowner Scenario B</h3>
    <p>
      A thief peers through a shed window and sees a generator and tools. Frosted film removes visibility instantly and 
      eliminates the “shopping window” problem.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Add Motion Lighting and a Camera</h2>
    <p>
      Detached structures need their own lighting and visibility—light from the house rarely reaches far enough.
    </p>

    <h3>Lighting Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Install a motion light facing the approach path to the shed or garage.</li>
      <li>Aim downward to avoid blasting the camera lens.</li>
      <li>Use dusk-to-dawn lighting for garages with vehicle access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Camera Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mount the camera on the house or fence, not the shed (intruders tamper with shed-mounted cameras first).</li>
      <li>Aim at the entry door and walkway leading to it.</li>
      <li>Use a narrow motion zone to avoid false triggers from animals.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For lighting/camera syncing, see 
      <a href="/home-security/security-lighting-placement.html">Security Lighting Placement</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Anchor Down High-Value Items</h2>
    <p>
      Even if someone gets inside, you can slow them down dramatically by anchoring your best equipment.
    </p>

    <h3>Anchor Methods</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a <strong>floor anchor loop</strong> for bikes, compressors, and generators.</li>
      <li>Secure tool cabinets with <strong>heavy cable locks</strong> or <strong>padlocked hasps</strong>.</li>
      <li>Mount shelves with <strong>lag bolts</strong> so they can’t be tipped.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Eliminate Blind Spots Around the Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Sheds often sit behind fences or in shadows—perfect cover for intruders. Fix the visibility gaps.
    </p>

    <h3>Visibility Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Trim vegetation around the structure.</li>
      <li>Light both sides of the shed, not just the front.</li>
      <li>Add a corner-mounted camera for 360° visibility if needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For more complete blind-zone elimination, see
      <a href="/home-security/spotting-surveillance-blind-zones.html">Spotting Surveillance Blind Zones</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Final 5-Minute Detached Structure Security Check</h2>
    <p>
      Walk around your shed or garage and look for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A weak or hollow door.</li>
      <li>Short screws in hinges or latches.</li>
      <li>Gaps big enough for a pry bar.</li>
      <li>Visible valuables through windows.</li>
      <li>Dark corners or shadow pockets.</li>
      <li>Loose, unanchored tools or equipment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once reinforced, detached structures stop being easy targets and start being actual secure spaces—not the softest
      entry on your property.

    <h1>Securing Garage Side Doors: The Weak Entry Most Homeowners Ignore</h1>

    <p>
      Most break-ins through garages don’t start with the big overhead door.  
      They start with the neglected side door — the service door on the exterior wall that homeowners forget about.
      These doors usually have cheap hinges, weak wooden frames, and bargain-bin latches that fold under pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want the garage to stop being a free access point, securing this door correctly matters more than anything
      else you do in the garage. Before upgrading hardware, check how this door fits into your
      <a href="/home-security/zone-based-security-planning.html">overall zoning plan</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Replace the Useless Factory Lock</h2>

    <p>
      Most garage side doors come with a basic knob-and-latch setup. These are for convenience, not security.
      Replace them immediately with something designed to take force.
    </p>

    <h3>Minimum Hardware You Should Have</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grade 1 or Grade 2 deadbolt</strong> — a real lock, not the $12 one from the hardware aisle.</li>
      <li><strong>Solid-metal strike plate</strong> with 3-inch screws that dig into the framing studs.</li>
      <li><strong>Heavy knob or lever</strong> that resists torque and prying.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For more detail on door hardware fundamentals, check the
      <a href="/home-security/best-door-and-window-locks.html">door and window hardware guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Reinforce the Door Frame</h2>

    <p>
      A strong lock is pointless if the frame is soft. Most garage frames are thin pine or spruce, which split easily
      under a boot. Reinforcement fixes that.
    </p>

    <h3>Effective Reinforcement Options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Steel strike box kits</strong> — replace the weak wood behind the deadbolt with metal.</li>
      <li><strong>Door jamb reinforcement plates</strong> — install long metal channels along the latch side.</li>
      <li><strong>Hinge-side reinforcement</strong> — prevents the door from being kicked at the hinge line.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Reinforcing the frame is the difference between a door that splits instantly and a door that forces the intruder
      to abandon the attempt. More frame details are in
      <a href="/home-security/reinforcing-door-frames.html">Reinforcing Door Frames</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Fix the Hinge Problem</h2>

    <p>
      Garage side doors often swing outward. This means the hinge pins are exposed — a huge vulnerability if the wrong
      hardware is installed.
    </p>

    <h3>Hinge Upgrades That Actually Matter</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Security hinges</strong> with non-removable pins.</li>
      <li><strong>Hinge studs</strong> that lock the door in place even if the pins are removed.</li>
      <li><strong>3-inch hinge screws</strong> to anchor the hinge side to the studs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your hinges look like they came from the cheapest contractor pack available, they need to be replaced today.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Add Lighting and Visibility</h2>

    <p>
      Garage side doors are usually placed in dark corners. That’s why intruders love them.
      Fix the darkness, and you remove half the opportunity.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Install a bright motion light aimed at the door and surrounding wall.</li>
      <li>Trim bushes or clutter that creates hiding spots.</li>
      <li>Add a camera with a downward angle covering both the door and the approach path.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Good placement rules are covered in the
      <a href="/home-security/indoor-vs-outdoor-security-cameras.html">camera comparison guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Include Alarm Sensors</h2>

    <p>
      This door should be part of your alarm perimeter every single time.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contact sensor:</strong> Required.</li>
      <li><strong>Shock sensor:</strong> Optional, but helpful if you get break-in attempts.</li>
      <li><strong>Camera motion zones:</strong> Detect presence before force is applied.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you want to understand how fast an alarm dispatches after a door breach,
      see <a href="/home-security/security-system-response-times.html">Security System Response Times</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Weatherproof Without Weakening Security</h2>

    <p>
      Garage doors take weather abuse. Weatherstripping and thresholds are fine — just don’t block the deadbolt or
      weaken the frame by installing soft materials behind the lock hardware.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use exterior-rated materials that don’t compress under pressure.</li>
      <li>Check that the deadbolt throws fully into the reinforced strike.</li>
      <li>Inspect swelling or rot yearly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A small maintenance habit beats replacing the entire door later.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Prioritize This Door Immediately</h2>

    <p>
      If intruders can get into the garage quietly, they can take their time breaking into the home’s interior door.
      Securing the service door stops that scenario before it begins.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Upgrade the lock.</li>
      <li>Reinforce the frame.</li>
      <li>Fix the hinges.</li>
      <li>Add lighting and sensors.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Do those four things and this door stops being a liability. It becomes one of the most secure exterior doors
      on the property — which is exactly what you want.

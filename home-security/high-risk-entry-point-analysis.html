    <h1>High-Risk Entry Point Analysis: How to Identify the Weak Spots Around Your Home</h1>

    <p>
      Most homeowners reinforce the wrong parts of their home.  
      Intruders don't pick entry points randomly—they gravitate toward weak hardware, blind corners, and easy access.
      A proper risk analysis shows you where your home is soft, and it tells you exactly what needs reinforcing first.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before you start evaluating, skim the
      <a href="/home-security/deterring-burglars-basics.html">Burglary Deterrence Basics</a>
      and the
      <a href="/home-security/zone-based-security-planning.html">zone planning guide</a>
      so you understand how entry points fit into the bigger system.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Start With the Perimeter Walk-Around</h2>

    <p>
      The best way to find your vulnerabilities is to walk around your home the same way an intruder would.
      Look for opportunities, not just problems.
    </p>

    <h3>Ask Yourself:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Can someone approach this area without being seen?</li>
      <li>Is there cover from shrubs, walls, vehicles, or sheds?</li>
      <li>Would noise be masked by distance or background sound?</li>
      <li>Is lighting weak, broken, or non-existent?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You’ll be surprised how many blind spots exist even on small properties.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Identify High-Risk Door Weaknesses</h2>

    <p>
      Doors are the number-one forced-entry target.  
      But not all doors are equal—some are significantly more vulnerable.
    </p>

    <h3>Check These First</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Garage side doors:</strong> Cheap locks, weak frames, hidden approach.</li>
      <li><strong>Double doors:</strong> Pry gap, flex, and poor astragal protection.</li>
      <li><strong>Back doors:</strong> Often unlit and out of sight.</li>
      <li><strong>Basement doors:</strong> Frequently ignored and lightly reinforced.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For specifics on reinforcing these entry points, see:
      <a href="/home-security/securing-garage-side-doors.html">garage door security</a> and
      <a href="/home-security/double-door-security-principles.html">double-door reinforcement</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Evaluate Vulnerable Windows</h2>

    <p>
      Windows are the second most common entry point—rarely by smashing glass, but by exploiting weak locks or lift-out tracks.
    </p>

    <h3>Prioritize Windows With These Traits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ground-level windows with no visibility.</li>
      <li>Windows hidden behind bushes or fencing.</li>
      <li>Basement or window-well windows.</li>
      <li>Sliders with weak track hardware.</li>
      <li>Sashes with flimsy factory latches.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      More detail is in the  
      <a href="/home-security/window-lock-types-explained.html">window lock guide</a> and  
      <a href="/home-security/basement-window-security-basics.html">basement window security</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Check for Structural Weak Points</h2>

    <p>
      Hardware is important, but structure is king.  
      Thin frames, rotted wood, and loose thresholds are easy wins for intruders because they bypass the lock entirely.
    </p>

    <h3>Look For</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Wood rot around door frames or thresholds.</li>
      <li>Loose siding that creates pry access.</li>
      <li>Window frames with excessive flex.</li>
      <li>Soft drywall or compromised studs near entry points.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If the structure is weak, upgrade that before investing in high-end locks.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Analyze Lighting, Sightlines, and Noise Cover</h2>

    <p>
      A door in a well-lit, highly visible spot is naturally more secure.  
      A door in a dark corner with shrub coverage is practically an invitation.
    </p>

    <h3>Evaluate These Factors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Is the area illuminated at night?</li>
      <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Can neighbors or passersby see activity?</li>
      <li><strong>Sound cover:</strong> Are there air conditioners, traffic, or fences blocking noise?</li>
      <li><strong>Camera angle:</strong> Is the approach monitored or blind?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Lighting, cameras, and cleared vegetation eliminate half of an intruder’s advantage.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Rank and Prioritize the Top Risks</h2>

    <p>
      A full inspection usually reveals 3–7 high-risk entry points.  
      Tackle them in order of predictability and vulnerability.
    </p>

    <h3>Your Action Sequence Should Be:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Secure the most hidden door or window first.</li>
      <li>Reinforce weak frames and hardware.</li>
      <li>Add lighting or remove cover.</li>
      <li>Install sensors on any remaining high-risk openings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The goal is to eliminate the easiest paths first.  
      Once those are gone, intruders usually move on.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Why This Analysis Works</h2>

    <p>
      Intruders don’t want noise, light, or time pressure.  
      High-risk entry points are simply locations where all three of those pressures are minimized.
      Fix the environment and the hardware, and you take away all the reasons someone would choose that spot.

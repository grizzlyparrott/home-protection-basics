    <h1>Wired vs Wireless Security Cameras: What Actually Matters</h1>

    <p>
      Camera marketing is loud, but the real differences between wired and wireless systems are simple:  
      how they get power, how they send video, and how reliable they are when something goes wrong.
      Everything else—apps, “AI features,” fancy packaging—is secondary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before choosing between them, check your layout using the  
      <a href="/home-security/camera-placement-guide.html">Camera Placement Guide</a>.
      The right placement matters more than the camera type.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Power: The Biggest Practical Difference</h2>

    <p>
      Wireless cameras are “wireless” only in one sense—they send video wirelessly.  
      They still need power unless they’re battery-only.
    </p>

    <h3>Wireless Power Options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Plug-in:</strong> Easiest install, but dependent on nearby outlets.</li>
      <li><strong>Battery-only:</strong> Fully wireless but need regular charging or battery swaps.</li>
      <li><strong>Solar-assisted:</strong> Helps reduce charging frequency but not a full replacement for direct power.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wired Power</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Runs off a dedicated cable (PoE or separate power).</li>
      <li>Never needs charging.</li>
      <li>Best long-term reliability.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you don’t want to deal with battery maintenance, go wired or plug-in wireless.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Video Transmission and Reliability</h2>

    <p>
      Wireless cameras depend on Wi-Fi, which means interference, distance limits, and bandwidth issues can affect performance.
      Wired cameras send video over a cable—no Wi-Fi, no interruptions.
    </p>

    <h3>Wireless Reliability</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Works fine in small or mid-size homes.</li>
      <li>Struggles through thick walls, metal siding, and long distances.</li>
      <li>Competes with every device on your network.</li>
      <li>Can drop offline during Wi-Fi congestion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wired Reliability</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Consistent 24/7 throughput.</li>
      <li>No RF interference.</li>
      <li>Superior for long cable runs or detached buildings.</li>
      <li>Handles high-resolution streams without compression artifacts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If reliability matters more than convenience, wired wins every time.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Installation Difficulty</h2>

    <p>
      Wireless is easier, but wired isn’t as bad as people think—especially with attic or crawl-space access.
    </p>

    <h3>Wireless Install</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Drill one mounting hole.</li>
      <li>Connect to Wi-Fi.</li>
      <li>Battery replacements or charging required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wired Install</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Requires running cable to each camera location.</li>
      <li>Needs a central NVR or PoE switch.</li>
      <li>Takes longer but is set-and-forget afterward.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you want the job done in 10–20 minutes per camera, wireless is easier.  
      If you want to never touch the camera again for years, wired is better.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Video Quality and Night Performance</h2>

    <p>
      Wireless cameras often compress video to fit Wi-Fi bandwidth.  
      Wired cameras can push full bitrates without choking.
    </p>

    <h3>Wireless Quality</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Good in ideal Wi-Fi conditions.</li>
      <li>Can degrade during interference or signal drops.</li>
      <li>Night vision may suffer from compression artifacts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wired Quality</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Consistent clarity day and night.</li>
      <li>Better detail for faces and license plates.</li>
      <li>More stable IR illumination performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Long-Term Maintenance</h2>

    <p>
      Wireless systems require more babysitting. Wired systems require almost none.
    </p>

    <h3>Wireless Maintenance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Battery swaps every few months.</li>
      <li>More troubleshooting and resets.</li>
      <li>Occasional re-pairing to Wi-Fi after outages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wired Maintenance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No batteries.</li>
      <li>Minimal network issues.</li>
      <li>Years of uninterrupted operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Which Should You Choose?</h2>

    <p>
      The answer depends on your priorities:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Choose wireless</strong> if speed of installation and app convenience matter most.</li>
      <li><strong>Choose wired</strong> if reliability, performance, and long-term stability matter most.</li>
      <li><strong>Mix both</strong> if your property size or layout demands it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Camera type is important, but placement still does more work than hardware.  
      Pair this guide with the  
      <a href="/home-security/camera-placement-guide.html">camera placement breakdown</a>  
      and you’ll build a coverage layout that actually works.

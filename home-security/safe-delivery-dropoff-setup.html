    <h1>Safe Delivery Dropoff Setup: Preventing Package Theft the Smart Way</h1>

    <p>
      Package theft is one of the fastest-growing home security problems. Thieves follow delivery trucks, scan for visible
      packages, and sweep porches quickly—usually in broad daylight. A “safe dropoff area” is not a gimmick; it’s a
      strategic setup designed to reduce visibility, control angles, and capture clear video if someone still tries to
      steal your delivery.
    </p>

    <p>
      This guide walks through placement, concealment, lighting, signage, and camera angles that actually work. For deeper
      camera guidance, pair this with the
      <a href="/home-security/camera-placement-guide.html">Camera Placement Guide</a> and
      <a href="/home-security/handling-backlight-and-glare.html">Handling Backlight and Glare</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Choose a Dropoff Location That Isn’t Visible From the Street</h2>
    <p>
      Most package theft happens because thieves can see boxes from their car or while walking by. Your first job is to
      break the line of sight.
    </p>

    <h3>Best Dropoff Locations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Behind a half wall or porch column.</li>
      <li>Beside a large planter that blocks direct view.</li>
      <li>Inside a recessed entryway or alcove.</li>
      <li>Behind a decorative bench or parcel box.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Homeowner Scenario A</h3>
    <p>
      Your porch is fully exposed. Deliveries sit dead-center in view of anyone driving by. By placing a planter near the
      porch edge and shifting the dropoff point behind it, packages disappear from street view without changing anything
      else about your setup.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Add a Camera Focused on the Approach Path (Not the Package)</h2>
    <p>
      You don’t need a camera pointing down at a box. You need a camera covering the <strong>path a thief would take</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Camera Placement Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mount 8–9 feet high for clear face capture.</li>
      <li>Aim at the walkway, driveway, or gate leading to your door.</li>
      <li>Avoid pointing directly at your dropoff area—this causes glare and shadows from delivery movement.</li>
      <li>Do not mount behind glass; IR glare ruins nighttime identification.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Homeowner Scenario B</h3>
    <p>
      Your doorbell camera captures the actual delivery but fails to capture the thief approaching from the side gate.
      Adding a secondary camera pointed at the walkway closes this blind spot entirely.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Use Lighting to Expose Movement, Not the Package</h2>
    <p>
      Light should reveal motion, not highlight the box thieves want to steal.
    </p>

    <h3>Lighting Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a downward-angled dusk-to-dawn light near the entry.</li>
      <li>Avoid lights pointed outward toward the street—they make packages more visible.</li>
      <li>Add a motion light aimed across your walkway, not directly at your camera.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If lighting causes shadows or camera flare, refer to
      <a href="/home-security/security-lighting-placement.html">Security Lighting Placement</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Use a Delivery Box or Concealment Method</h2>
    <p>
      A simple concealment method dramatically cuts theft. Thieves look for exposed packages—not hidden ones.
    </p>

    <h3>Concealment Options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lockable parcel box:</strong> USPS-approved models are sturdy and weatherproof.</li>
      <li><strong>Bench with storage:</strong> Looks decorative, hides deliveries.</li>
      <li><strong>Large planter shield:</strong> A tall plant or pot blocks direct view of the dropoff zone.</li>
      <li><strong>Small privacy screen:</strong> Lightweight, cheap, and very effective at blocking line of sight.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Add Clear Signage (It Actually Works)</h2>
    <p>
      Most delivery drivers will place packages where you tell them. Simple signage removes ambiguity.
    </p>

    <h3>Effective Signs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>“Deliveries: Place Behind Planter”</li>
      <li>“Packages → Drop Box”</li>
      <li>“Please Place Packages Behind Bench”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These signs are not for thieves—they’re for drivers. Thieves already look for quick-grab boxes sitting in the open.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Keep the Area Clean and Uncluttered</h2>
    <p>
      Clutter creates hiding spots for packages and for intruders. Clean lines also make it easier for cameras to capture
      movement.
    </p>

    <h3>Quick Cleanup Checklist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove old packages, bags, or shipping waste immediately.</li>
      <li>Keep porch floors and walkway edges clear.</li>
      <li>Trim plants that block your camera’s line of sight.</li>
      <li>Make sure decorative items don’t create shadows or glare.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. If You Travel: Lock It Down</h2>
    <p>
      Porch pirates check for homes with multiple packages sitting out. If you're gone for 2+ days, use these measures:
    </p>

    <h3>Travel Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Amazon Locker, UPS Store pickup, or USPS Hold Mail.</li>
      <li>Ask a neighbor you trust to collect packages.</li>
      <li>Do not rely on a doorbell camera alone—thieves move fast.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once your delivery zone is concealed, monitored, and well-lit, your porch stops being an easy target and starts
      acting like a controlled receiving area—not an open shelf for thieves.
    </p>

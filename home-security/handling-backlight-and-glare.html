    <h1>Handling Backlight and Glare: Fixing Useless Security Footage</h1>

    <p>
      Backlight is one of the main reasons homeowners get unusable footage—silhouettes instead of faces, blown-out
      backgrounds instead of details, and nighttime glare that floods the entire frame. Cameras don’t “think”; they expose
      based on the brightest object in view. If that bright object sits behind the person you want to identify, your
      camera will sacrifice the subject and expose for the background instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before adjusting anything, it helps to understand why backlight happens and how a few small angle changes can turn
      unusable footage into clear identification-level video.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Why Backlight Happens</h2>
    <p>
      Every camera sensor has a limited dynamic range—its ability to handle dark and bright areas at the same time. When a
      bright light source (like the sun or a porch light) hits the sensor directly, the camera exposes for that bright
      region and darkens everything else.
    </p>

    <h3>Typical Homeowner Scenarios</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scenario A:</strong> Your front camera faces the street. Every morning, the sunrise behind passing people
          blows the entire frame white.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenario B:</strong> A driveway camera points toward your garage. Your neighbor’s bright dusk-to-dawn
          light enters the top-left corner and washes out the entire view.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenario C:</strong> Your porch camera is under an overhang, but shiny vehicles in the driveway bounce
          sunlight directly into the lens at certain times of day.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Quick Diagnostic Test</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If a person appears as a silhouette, you’re facing a strong backlight source.</li>
      <li>If the background is pure white, the camera is overexposed.</li>
      <li>If nighttime footage shows big glowing halos, IR glare is bouncing off nearby surfaces.</li>
      <li>If footage looks fine at noon but terrible at sunrise or sunset, the sun angle is your culprit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Step-by-Step: Fix the Angle First</h2>
    <p>
      Angle changes solve most backlight issues. Camera settings help only after the physical placement is corrected.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Adjust the Angle Correctly</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rotate the camera 10–20 degrees</strong> so the bright source leaves the frame.</li>
      <li><strong>Lower the camera</strong> so the horizon or sky occupies less of the shot.</li>
      <li><strong>Aim slightly downward</strong> to keep reflective surfaces out of view.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid pointing east or west</strong>, where sunrise and sunset cause the strongest backlight.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Even small adjustments drastically improve exposure. Many homeowners mount cameras straight forward by default, even
      when a slight tilt would avoid the brightest parts of the scene.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Avoid Direct Light Sources Entirely</h2>
    <p>
      Cameras struggle when facing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Porch lights mounted near the lens</li>
      <li>Streetlights in the background</li>
      <li>Reflective windows and sliding doors</li>
      <li>Chrome trim, white siding, or vehicles</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you can see the light source in the frame, the camera does too—and it will expose for that object instead of the
      subject you care about.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Use WDR Correctly (But Don’t Rely on It)</h2>
    <p>
      Wide Dynamic Range helps balance dark and bright areas, but it cannot overcome severe backlight on its own. WDR
      should be turned on after the physical angle is corrected. Otherwise, the sensor is still overwhelmed.
    </p>

    <h3>WDR Diagnostic</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If turning on WDR makes the entire image gray and flat, the camera is still facing too much brightness.</li>
      <li>If WDR improves faces but the background still blows out, lower the camera or reduce reflective surfaces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Never Install Cameras Behind Glass</h2>
    <p>
      Glass causes two problems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Daytime glare:</strong> Sunlight reflects off the glass surface into the lens.</li>
      <li><strong>Nighttime IR blowback:</strong> Infrared LEDs bounce off the window and blind the camera completely.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your footage shows white “snowstorm” effects or glowing fog at night, this is why. Cameras must be mounted
      outside the glass to get usable nighttime video.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Fix Nighttime Glare and IR Blowback</h2>
    <p>
      Night glare comes from IR LEDs bouncing off nearby walls, railings, posts, or reflective siding.</p>

    <h3>Step-by-Step Fix</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Move the camera forward so IR light clears nearby surfaces.</li>
      <li>Aim the lens away from white or glossy siding.</li>
      <li>Clean the lens and IR window—dust amplifies glare.</li>
      <li>Use a camera with adjustable IR strength if glare persists.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Add a Sun Shield or Overhang</h2>
    <p>
      A sun hood blocks direct sunlight during peak hours. If your camera is already under a soffit or overhang, angle the
      lens so the hood blocks more of the overhead glare.

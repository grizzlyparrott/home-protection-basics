      <h2>Why Backlight Destroys Footage</h2>
      <p>
        Cameras don’t think—they react. When a bright light source is behind a person (sunlight, a car headlight, or a porch light), the sensor dumps exposure into the bright area and turns everything else into a silhouette. Glare does the same thing but from reflective surfaces—glass, glossy siding, metal trim, even nearby vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is predictable: washed-out frames, blown highlights, and zero identification value.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Fix #1: Change the Angle, Not the Camera</h2>
      <p>
        You don’t need a new camera; you need a different angle. Rotate the camera so the brightest object isn’t directly in frame. Even a 10–20° shift can eliminate backlight entirely. Most homeowners mount cameras too high and too straight—lowering or offsetting solves more problems than any setting does.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fix #2: Avoid Direct Light Sources</h2>
      <p>
        Cameras die when they stare at:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Porch lights</li>
        <li>Streetlights</li>
        <li>Sunrise/Sunset direction (east/west)</li>
        <li>Neighbor’s bright security lights</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Position the camera so these sources land outside the main view. Identify the brightest offender and move until it’s gone.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fix #3: Use WDR (Wide Dynamic Range) Properly</h2>
      <p>
        WDR works, but only if the camera isn’t overwhelmed. Turn WDR on and leave it—don’t keep adjusting it. Strong backlight will beat WDR if the camera is aimed poorly. Think of WDR as a boost, not a solution.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fix #4: Stop Installing Cameras Behind Glass</h2>
      <p>
        Glass reflects indoor lights, sunlight, and IR. If you mount a camera inside a window, you will get glare—every time. IR bounces straight back into the sensor and smokes the entire frame.
      </p>
      <p>Mount cameras outdoors. If you absolutely can’t, shut off IR and eliminate interior reflections.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fix #5: Remove Reflective Surfaces in View</h2>
      <p>
        Shiny cars, metal trim, bright vinyl siding, and windows all bounce sunlight into the camera. Either reposition the camera or adjust the environment—add a matte surface, reposition a vehicle, or change the mounting height.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fix #6: Use a Sun Shield or Hood</h2>
      <p>
        A small hood or overhang blocks direct sunlight and helps the sensor avoid overload. If your camera supports clip-on visors, use one. Otherwise, mounting under soffits creates the same effect.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fix #7: Adjust Night Lighting</h2>
      <p>
        Bright white LEDs close to the camera cause night glare. Either dim them, angle them outward, or replace them with motion-activated units that activate away from the lens. IR reflectivity from walls and siding is the most common night glare source—fix the angle.

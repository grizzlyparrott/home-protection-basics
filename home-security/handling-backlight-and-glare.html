    <h1>Handling Backlight and Glare: Fixing Useless Security Footage</h1>

    <p>
      Backlight is one of the fastest ways to ruin security footage. When the brightest object in the frame sits behind a
      person—sunlight, car headlights, or even a porch light—the camera exposes for the bright area and turns the subject
      into a silhouette. Glare does the same thing by bouncing light off windows, siding, or vehicles. The result is the
      same: washed-out footage and zero identification value.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Identify the Light Source Overpowering the Camera</h2>
    <p>
      You can’t fix backlight until you know what’s causing it. Look for anything in or near the frame that’s significantly
      brighter than the surrounding area. Common offenders include yard lights, streetlights, sunrise and sunset angles,
      and reflective surfaces like cars or windows.
    </p>

    <h3>Easy Diagnostic Checks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The subject appears as a dark outline or silhouette.</li>
      <li>The background is blown out or completely white.</li>
      <li>Night glare intensifies when the IR LEDs activate.</li>
      <li>Footage looks fine at some hours and unusable at others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Fix the Angle First—Not the Settings</h2>
    <p>
      A small angle change solves most backlight problems. When the camera no longer faces the brightest object directly,
      the sensor can expose the entire frame correctly. Lowering the camera, shifting it left or right, or aiming slightly
      downward all help reduce or eliminate the bright source.
    </p>

    <h3>Best Angle Adjustments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid pointing the lens toward the sun’s path (east and west especially).</li>
      <li>Keep porch lights and driveway floods outside the main field of view.</li>
      <li>Aim cameras so reflective surfaces aren’t facing the lens.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Use WDR, But Don’t Expect Miracles</h2>
    <p>
      Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) helps balance dark and bright areas, but it cannot fix severe backlight on its own. Think of
      WDR as a boost—useful, but only after the angle is corrected. Cameras overwhelmed by direct light will still struggle
      even with WDR enabled.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Stop Mounting Cameras Behind Glass</h2>
    <p>
      Indoor-to-outdoor filming through a window guarantees problems. Daytime glare reflects room light into the camera.
      At night, the infrared LEDs bounce off the glass and blind the sensor entirely. If you want usable footage, the
      camera must be mounted outside the window, not behind it.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Control Exterior Lighting at Night</h2>
    <p>
      Bright white LEDs close to the camera create a halo effect and ruin detail. If possible, reposition or dim these
      lights, or angle them downward. IR glare from siding and walls is another common issue—adjust the camera downward or
      further from reflective surfaces to reduce blowback.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Use a Sun Shield or Overhang to Reduce Severe Backlight</h2>
    <p>
      A small hood or visor blocks direct overhead sunlight and makes exposure far more stable. Many cameras include
      built-in shields; if yours doesn’t, mounting the camera under a soffit produces the same effect.

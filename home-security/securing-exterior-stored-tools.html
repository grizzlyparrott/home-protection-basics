    <h1>Securing Exterior Stored Tools So Burglars Cannot Use Them</h1>

    <p>
      A lot of break-ins get easier because the homeowner left everything the intruder needed sitting outside:
      ladders, shovels, pry bars, even power tools. You do not need to turn your yard into a fortress, but you
      do need to stop handing out free equipment.
    </p>

    <p>
      This guide walks through how to lock down exterior tools, where to store them, and how to build a simple
      routine so nothing useful is left lying around. If you have not looked at your overall layout yet, pair
      this with the <a href="/home-security/perimeter-security-fundamentals.html">Perimeter Security Fundamentals</a>
      so your tool storage fits into the bigger picture.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What Counts as “Exterior Stored Tools”</h2>

    <p>
      When you hear “tools,” do not just think about the toolbox. From a burglar’s point of view, anything that
      helps with climbing, prying, smashing, or hiding counts as a tool.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ladders:</strong> extension, step, folding, and telescoping ladders.</li>
      <li><strong>Yard tools:</strong> shovels, rakes, hoes, digging bars, post-hole diggers.</li>
      <li><strong>Impact tools:</strong> sledgehammers, axes, mauls, mattocks.</li>
      <li><strong>Hand tools:</strong> pry bars, crowbars, large screwdrivers, pliers.</li>
      <li><strong>Power tools:</strong> cordless drills, grinders, saws stored in sheds or on porches.</li>
      <li><strong>“Furniture” items:</strong> stackable chairs, trash cans, and benches that can become step-stools.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Anything in that list left loose outdoors is basically you saying, “Here, use this on my doors and windows.”
    </p>

    <h2>2. How Burglars Actually Use Your Tools</h2>

    <p>
      Most residential burglars do not show up with a full kit. They walk the property first and improvise.
      Common moves:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ladders:</strong> used to reach second-story windows, balconies, or roof access points that are less protected.</li>
      <li><strong>Pry bars and shovels:</strong> used to pop weak door frames, side garage doors, or basement window wells.</li>
      <li><strong>Sledgehammers:</strong> used to smash padlocks off sheds or check how sturdy a door actually is.</li>
      <li><strong>Power tools:</strong> used to remove hinges, strike plates, or cut through simple hasps.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Your goal is simple: make sure anything that could help with those moves is either locked away or locked down.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Priority Order: Remove, Lock In, Lock Down</h2>

    <p>
      Do not overthink it. Use this order when you look at each tool or piece of equipment outside:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Remove:</strong> If you do not use it, get rid of it.</li>
      <li><strong>Lock in:</strong> If you do use it, store it in something that locks (shed, garage, deck box).</li>
      <li><strong>Lock down:</strong> If it has to stay outside, physically secure it so it is annoying to use or steal.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      This is not about perfection. It is about taking away the fast, easy options so your house is not the simple target.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Locking Tools Inside: Sheds, Garages, and Deck Boxes</h2>

    <p>
      Best case, your tools live behind a real door with a real lock. That usually means:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>garage</strong> with a solid-core side door and deadbolt.</li>
      <li>A <strong>shed</strong> with a reinforced hasp and decent padlock.</li>
      <li>A <strong>lockable deck box</strong> for smaller items and hand tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your shed or garage door hardware is weak, fix that first. A cheap, thin hasp screwed into soft wood is
      not security; it is decoration.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use through-bolts with washers instead of short wood screws.</li>
      <li>Pick a closed-shackle padlock that is harder to cut.</li>
      <li>Make sure the door itself is not rotten or hollow.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For more on door and hardware basics, see the
      <a href="/home-security/door-reinforcement-basics.html">Door Reinforcement Basics</a> guide once you have it in place.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Securing Ladders So They Cannot Be Borrowed</h2>

    <p>
      Ladders are one of the highest-risk items you can leave outside. They turn second-story windows into “ground level.”
    </p>

    <p>Good options for ladder security:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Indoor storage:</strong> store ladders in the garage or shed whenever possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Wall brackets:</strong> mount ladder hooks to a wall and run a padlock or cable lock through the rungs.</li>
      <li><strong>Ground anchor:</strong> use a concrete-set or screw-in ground anchor and a hardened chain to lock the ladder down.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Bare minimum: the ladder should require a lock to move. If someone can just pick it up and walk away with it,
      it is also easy to use on your own house.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Bundling and Locking Yard Tools</h2>

    <p>
      Long-handled yard tools are awkward to steal, but easy to use as prying and striking tools.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Store them upright in a <strong>locked shed</strong> or enclosed corner of the garage.</li>
      <li>If they must stay outside, <strong>bundle them</strong> through the handles with a cable lock.</li>
      <li>Aim to have <strong>one locked bundle</strong>, not six loose tools sticking out of the ground.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Power tools should never be left on a porch, in an open carport, or in an unlocked bench. If it has a battery
      and a handle, it goes in locked storage when you are done.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Using Light and Cameras Around Tool Storage</h2>

    <p>
      Locks are the first layer. Visibility is the second. You want anyone messing with your shed, garage side door,
      or deck box to be lit up and, ideally, recorded.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use <strong>motion lights</strong> aimed at your shed doors and side yard, not just the driveway.</li>
      <li>Avoid blinding glare; angle lights down and across, not straight into the camera.</li>
      <li>Position at least one <strong>camera</strong> so it covers your primary tool storage area and access paths.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you are deciding how to light those areas, see
      <a href="/home-security/motion-light-vs-dusk-to-dawn.html">Motion vs Dusk-to-Dawn Lighting</a>
      for a breakdown of where each type actually works.
    </p>

    <p>
      For camera angles and coverage, pair this with the
      <a href="/home-security/camera-placement-guide.html">Camera Placement Guide</a>
      so your storage areas are not sitting in blind spots.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Tie Tool Security Into Your Night Routine</h2>

    <p>
      None of this matters if tools slowly creep back outside and never make it in. The fix is habit, not more hardware.
    </p>

    <p>
      Build a quick end-of-day sweep into your normal wind-down:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Walk the yard and driveway.</li>
      <li>Put every tool back in its storage, every time.</li>
      <li>Verify the shed, garage side door, and gates are locked.</li>
      <li>Check the ladder is stored and locked, not leaning on the house.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you want a simple pattern to follow, plug this into your
      <a href="/home-security/night-security-routine.html">Night Security Routine</a>
      so it happens automatically instead of “when you remember.”
    </p>

    <h2>9. Quick Checklist: Exterior Tools Secured</h2>

    <p>Run this checklist once now and then monthly as a sanity check:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>No ladders left loose outside.</li>
      <li>All long-handled tools stored in a locked space or bundled and locked.</li>
      <li>Power tools never left on porches, patios, or open carports overnight.</li>
      <li>Shed or garage doors have solid hardware and real locks, not decorative hasps.</li>
      <li>Motion lighting covers tool storage areas and approach paths.</li>
      <li>At least one camera angle covers your main storage area, if you run cameras at all.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You will never remove every risk, but cutting off easy access to tools alone makes your home much less attractive
      to the kind of intruder who wants a fast, quiet job and no surprises.

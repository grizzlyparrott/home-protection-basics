    <h1>Reinforcing Door Frames: Stop Easy Kick-Ins</h1>

    <p>
      Most “break-ins” aren’t lockpicking—they’re kicks. The weak point isn’t the deadbolt, it’s the soft wood around
      the strike plate. A strong lock in a weak frame is pointless. This guide shows exactly how to reinforce the frame
      so it survives real force. If you haven’t upgraded your locks yet, review the
      <a href="/home-security/best-door-and-window-locks.html">Best Locks Guide</a> first.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Why Door Frames Fail</h2>
    <p>
      Standard door frames use thin pine that splits instantly when the strike plate pulls out. Factory screws are short,
      soft, and barely bite into the stud behind the jamb. One solid kick is usually enough to burst the frame.
    </p>

    <h3>The real weak points</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Short 1/2"–3/4" screws that rip straight out.</li>
      <li>Strike plates mounted only to trim wood.</li>
      <li>Hinges using the same short screws.</li>
      <li>Hollow-core doors creating flex and shock.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Reinforcement fixes all of these with a few cheap parts and a drill.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Upgrade #1: 3-Inch Screws Into the Stud</h2>
    <p>
      This is the single biggest improvement you can make. Replacing the short screws in both the strike plate and the
      hinges locks the frame into the wall stud instead of flimsy trim.
    </p>

    <h3>How to do it</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove old screws from strike plate and hinges.</li>
      <li>Replace with 3" hardened screws angled slightly inward.</li>
      <li>Do this on the top two and bottom two hinge screws, minimum.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This alone stops most kick-ins. It’s also recommended in the
      <a href="/home-security/security-system-failure-points.html">Failure Points Guide</a>
      because physical security supports alarm performance.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Upgrade #2: Heavy-Duty Strike Plate</h2>
    <p>
      A high-quality Grade 1 deadbolt is useless if the strike plate is thin stamped metal.
    </p>

    <h3>What to look for</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Solid steel, not decorative aluminum.</li>
      <li>Four or six mounting holes, not two.</li>
      <li>Deep bolt pocket that fully receives the deadbolt.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A reinforced strike plate spreads impact force across more wood and deeper fasteners.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Upgrade #3: Full Door Jamb Reinforcement Kits</h2>
    <p>
      These kits include long steel sleeves that run the full length of the door jamb. They distribute force across the
      entire frame instead of one small section.
    </p>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Makes the door behave like a solid unit.</li>
      <li>Greatly increases resistance to kicking and prying.</li>
      <li>Often cheaper than replacing the entire door.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These are ideal for high-risk entry points identified in your
      <a href="/home-security/high-risk-entry-point-analysis.html">Entry Point Analysis</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Upgrade #4: Reinforcing Your Hinges</h2>
    <p>
      If the hinge side splits, the door fails just as easily as a weak strike plate.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use 3" screws to anchor hinges deep into studs.</li>
      <li>Consider hinge shields if the door has visible gaps.</li>
      <li>Add a security hinge pin for outswing doors.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Reinforcing hinges also reduces alignment drift, which prevents contact sensor false alarms—linked in the
      <a href="/home-security/false-alarm-prevention-guide.html">False Alarm Guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Upgrade #5: Use a Solid-Core or Steel Door</h2>
    <p>
      The frame matters most, but the door still plays a role. Hollow-core interior doors are worthless for security.
    </p>

    <h3>Best options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Solid-core wood exterior door.</li>
      <li>Steel-clad security door.</li>
      <li>Fiberglass reinforced door.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. How to Test Your Reinforced Door</h2>
    <p>
      After reinforcement, test the door the right way—without destroying anything.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Check that the deadbolt fully extends into the strike.</li>
      <li>Pull aggressively from the outside to feel flex.</li>
      <li>Verify hinge screws sit flush and tight.</li>
      <li>Ensure the door doesn’t bind or drag after reinforcement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A properly reinforced frame feels solid, heavy, and stable.

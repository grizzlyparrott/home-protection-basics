    <h1>Motion Detection Settings: How to Cut False Alerts and Catch Real Movement</h1>

    <p>
      Motion detection is only useful if it alerts you to the right things.  
      Out of the box, most cameras trigger on shadows, rain, headlights, insects, and anything else that moves.
      That wastes time and makes you ignore real alerts. Proper settings fix that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before adjusting sensitivity, review the  
      <a href="/home-security/camera-placement-guide.html">Camera Placement Guide</a>.  
      Bad placement increases false alerts no matter what settings you use.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Use Motion Zones Instead of Full-Screen Detection</h2>

    <p>
      Full-screen detection is the fastest way to flood yourself with false alerts.  
      Motion zones let you tell the camera what areas matter.
    </p>

    <h3>Good Zone Practices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Exclude roads, sidewalks, and neighbor yards.</li>
      <li>Focus on approach paths, doors, windows, and driveways.</li>
      <li>Cut out tree lines and branches that move constantly.</li>
      <li>Avoid placing zones low where animals walk frequently.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Zones matter more than sensitivity. Get them right first.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Set Sensitivity Based on Distance and Purpose</h2>

    <p>
      Sensitivity controls how small a movement triggers the camera. Too high, and you get spammed. Too low, and you miss events.
    </p>

    <h3>General Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>High sensitivity:</strong> Good for doorbell cams and close-range areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Medium sensitivity:</strong> Best for driveways and side yards.</li>
      <li><strong>Low sensitivity:</strong> Open yards or long distances where subjects appear smaller.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Adjust sensitivity gradually. Don’t jump from 10 to 100 or 100 to 10.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Use Smart/AI Filters if Your System Has Them</h2>

    <p>
      Modern cameras include filtering that identifies people, vehicles, animals, and general motion.
      These filters cut false alerts dramatically when configured correctly.
    </p>

    <h3>Best Practices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Enable “People Only” alerts for doors and windows.</li>
      <li>Enable “Vehicle Detection” for driveways.</li>
      <li>Avoid using “All Motion” unless you need it for specific reasons.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Use filters to reduce noise—you want fewer alerts, not more.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Reduce Glare and IR Reflection</h2>

    <p>
      False triggers often come from IR glare bouncing off reflective surfaces, insects circling LEDs, or rain hitting the lens.
    </p>

    <h3>Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Move the camera slightly farther from walls or soffits.</li>
      <li>Trim plants close to the camera.</li>
      <li>Angle away from surfaces that reflect IR.</li>
      <li>Use white-light motion illumination to reduce IR dependence.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For night issues, combine this with the  
      <a href="/home-security/night-vision-performance-basics.html">Night Vision Performance Guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Adjust Alert Frequency and Cooldown</h2>

    <p>
      Some systems allow you to limit how often alerts trigger during continuous movement.
    </p>

    <h3>When to Use Cooldown</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Busy streets where cars pass constantly.</li>
      <li>Windy days with heavy vegetation movement.</li>
      <li>Areas with frequent animal traffic.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Cooldown prevents alert spam without missing important events.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Test Your Settings With Real Walkthroughs</h2>

    <p>
      The only way to know if your settings work is to walk through the monitored area.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Walk the approach path as if you were an intruder.</li>
      <li>Test slow movement and fast movement.</li>
      <li>Check if the alert fires at the right distance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Take 10 minutes to test—it saves months of frustration later.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Recheck Settings After Seasonal Changes</h2>

    <p>
      Sun angle, shadows, foliage, and weather all change yearly.  
      Motion settings that worked in winter may fail in summer.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Re-evaluate zones every 3–4 months.</li>
      <li>Re-test night performance during hot or humid seasons.</li>
      <li>Adjust sensitivity as foliage grows or dies off.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Proper tuning makes your cameras smart instead of loud.

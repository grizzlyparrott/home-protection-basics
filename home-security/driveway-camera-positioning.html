    <h1>Driveway Camera Positioning: Capturing Plates, Faces, and Movement</h1>

    <p>
      Driveway cameras matter more than people think. This is the spot where vehicles enter, where packages sit, and where
      strangers approach long before reaching a front door. But most driveway cameras are mounted too high, pointed too
      wide, or facing the wrong direction—resulting in footage that looks fine until you actually need a plate or a face.
    </p>

    <p>
      This guide focuses only on driveway-specific angles, mounting height, and real-world tests to make sure you capture
      the details that matter. If you want broader placement rules first, the
      <a href="/home-security/camera-placement-guide.html">Camera Placement Guide</a> is a good foundation.
    </p>

    <h2>1. The Mission: Capture Faces + Capture Plates</h2>
    <p>
      A driveway camera has two jobs: identify the person and identify the vehicle. But one angle rarely does both
      perfectly. That’s why the goal is not “the perfect shot”—it’s consistent, readable detail across both.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Most Driveway Cameras Fail</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mounted too high (over 10 feet).</li>
      <li>Aimed too wide, catching the whole yard instead of the approach path.</li>
      <li>Facing headlights, causing nighttime blowout.</li>
      <li>Mounted on the garage pointing outward—maximizing glare and minimizing facial detail.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Homeowner Scenario A</h3>
    <p>
      You installed a camera above your garage at 12 feet, aiming down the driveway. It captures the vehicle shape but not
      the front plate. Faces are just the tops of heads. At night, headlights blow out the entire frame. The angle—not the
      camera—is the problem.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Correct Mounting Height: 8–9 Feet</h2>
    <p>
      This is the sweet spot. Low enough to catch faces head-on, high enough to avoid tampering.
    </p>

    <h3>Rules for Driveway Height</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>8–9 feet high</strong> for general ID and clarity.</li>
      <li><strong>6–7 feet</strong> if you want extreme detail on faces (side wall mount only).</li>
      <li><strong>10 feet max</strong> if positioned on a soffit—any higher loses facial geometry.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Mounting above the garage door often works only if the driveway slopes downward toward the street. If the driveway
      slopes upward, the camera will never get faces—only chests and shoulders.
    </p>

    <h3>Quick Diagnostic Height Test</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stand where someone would walk toward your home.</li>
      <li>Look at your camera—can you see your own face clearly?</li>
      <li>If the answer is no, the camera is too high or too angled down.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Correct Angle: Aim at the Approach Path, Not the Whole Driveway</h2>
    <p>
      A driveway camera should not show your entire driveway. It should show <strong>the path vehicles and people actually
      travel.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Best Angle Guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid wide 120–180° shots—zoom or narrow the view to the entry line.</li>
      <li>Aim the camera so the center of frame is where tires or feet travel.</li>
      <li>Angle slightly downward (10–15°) to reduce sky, glare, and headlights.</li>
      <li>If capturing plates, aim toward the vehicle’s final slow-speed point (top of driveway or parking spot).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Homeowner Scenario B</h3>
    <p>
      Your driveway curves slightly. A front-mounted garage camera can’t see faces until people are almost at the door.
      A better position is on the right-side wall or fence line, aimed along the curve, so faces are visible the entire
      approach.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Avoid Headlights and Sunrise/Sunset Angles</h2>
    <p>
      Headlights are the #1 reason night footage becomes useless. The sensor gets blasted and compresses all detail.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Avoid It</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not position the camera directly facing the street.</li>
      <li>Do not point the camera up the driveway if cars drive straight into the lens.</li>
      <li>Mount slightly off-center—5–10 feet left or right of the main vehicle path.</li>
      <li>Aim the lens away from sunrise/sunset paths if possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diagnostic Light Test</h3>
    <p>
      Have someone pull into your driveway with headlights on.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the frame washes out white, shift the camera 5–10° sideways.</li>
      <li>If the glare persists, move the camera off the direct vehicle path entirely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Capturing Plates: You Need a Secondary Angle</h2>
    <p>
      One camera <em>may</em> get plates, but two angles get them reliably—one high-level ID shot and one lower, angled
      plate shot.
    </p>

    <h3>Plate Capture Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Angle should be shallow—no more than 30° off-center from the plate.</li>
      <li>Mount 6–8 feet high on a side wall or fence.</li>
      <li>Field of view should stay narrow: 30–60°.</li>
      <li>Night IR should not reflect off glossy bumpers—angle sideways to avoid blowback.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you regularly want plates, consider setting one camera strictly for vehicle ID and using a second for faces and
      general monitoring.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Motion Zones for Driveways</h2>
    <p>
      Overly wide motion zones cause constant false alerts. Instead, set tight detection only around:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>the main vehicle entry path</li>
      <li>the front walkway leading to your door</li>
      <li>the parking spot or garage entry</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For best accuracy, pair these settings with the guidance in
      <a href="/home-security/motion-detection-settings.html">Motion Detection Settings</a>.

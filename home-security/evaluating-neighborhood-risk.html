    <h1>Evaluating Neighborhood Risk: What Actually Matters</h1>

    <p>
      Crime maps and “danger ratings” online are usually outdated, misleading, or based on incomplete data.
      To understand your home’s true risk level, you need to look at the patterns that actually matter:
      access routes, visibility, opportunistic behavior, and the overall condition of the surrounding area.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before digging into neighborhood indicators, make sure your property perimeter is already assessed properly.
      The <a href="../home-security/perimeter-security-fundamentals.html">Perimeter Security Fundamentals</a>
      guide explains how intruders typically approach homes in vulnerable areas.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Look at the Access Routes to Your Street</h2>

    <p>
      Most property crime is opportunistic. Intruders choose neighborhoods they can move through quickly
      without being noticed. Key factors include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fast entry/exit routes:</strong> direct streets leading to highways or busy roads.</li>
      <li><strong>Back alleys or utility easements:</strong> provide hidden access behind homes.</li>
      <li><strong>Low visibility approaches:</strong> bends, dips, and dead zones created by terrain.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your home backs up to a path or easement, review
      <a href="../home-security/securing-exterior-stored-tools.html">Securing Exterior Stored Tools</a>
      to remove items intruders often use when exploiting low-visibility areas.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Observe the Behavior Patterns, Not the Statistics</h2>

    <p>
      Statistics don’t tell you who is moving through the neighborhood or when.
      Behavior patterns tell you much more:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>People checking door handles late at night.</li>
      <li>Foot traffic that doesn’t match normal neighborhood use.</li>
      <li>Cars slowly driving the same loop repeatedly.</li>
      <li>Trash dumping, vandalism, or broken fences.</li>
      <li>New graffiti—especially repeated tagging.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Many homeowners spot suspicious patterns from cameras. If your sightlines are narrow, use the 
      <a href="../home-security/spotting-surveillance-blind-zones.html">Blind Zone Checklist</a>
      to clean up your coverage first.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Evaluate Lighting and Visibility on Your Street</h2>

    <p>
      A well-lit street dramatically reduces nighttime property crime. Look at:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Whether streetlights work and how evenly they spread light.</li>
      <li>Shadow pockets where people can hide between homes.</li>
      <li>Trees and shrubs blocking streetlight coverage.</li>
      <li>Homes with consistent dusk-to-dawn lighting.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your home contributes to dark zones, the  
      <a href="../home-security/motion-light-vs-dusk-to-dawn.html">Lighting Comparison Guide</a>  
      explains how to fix lighting gaps around your property.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Look for Signs of Neighborhood Maintenance</h2>

    <p>
      Intruders actively avoid well-maintained neighborhoods. Key indicators:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Yards kept clean and trimmed</li>
      <li>Fences intact and repaired quickly</li>
      <li>Street parking not overcrowded</li>
      <li>Minimal abandoned vehicles or debris</li>
      <li>Neighbors who actually look outside when something happens</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Neglected properties send a message that nobody is watching—which lowers the perceived risk
      for potential intruders.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Pay Attention to “Criminal Convenience Factors”</h2>

    <p>
      These are small signals that intruders use when picking easy targets:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Multiple homes with unlocked side gates</li>
      <li>Dark pathways between houses</li>
      <li>Visible packages left out overnight</li>
      <li>Garage doors regularly left open</li>
      <li>Tools or ladders left outside</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Many of these overlap with problems covered in the  
      <a href="../home-security/attic-and-crawlspace-security.html">Attic & Crawlspace Security Guide</a>,  
      where intruders exploit overlooked access points.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Talk to the People Who Actually Live There</h2>

    <p>
      The most accurate information comes from:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Long-term neighbors</li>
      <li>Local delivery drivers</li>
      <li>Mail carriers</li>
      <li>HOA members or community groups</li>
      <li>People who walk the neighborhood daily</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These people know the patterns outsiders never see.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Quick Neighborhood Risk Checklist</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Streetlights functional with minimal dark zones</li>
      <li>Homes and yards appear consistently maintained</li>
      <li>No alley or easement access directly behind the home</li>
      <li>Neighbors visibly active and aware</li>
      <li>No consistent suspicious traffic patterns</li>
      <li>No open invitations (tools, ladders, open gates)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Evaluating your neighborhood realistically gives you the right expectations and helps you
      prioritize upgrades that matter.  
      A secure home starts with understanding the environment around it.

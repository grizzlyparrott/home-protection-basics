    <h1>Double Door Security Principles: How to Lock Down Paired Doors Correctly</h1>

    <p>
      Double doors look great, but they create security problems that single doors simply don’t have.  
      You have two panels, two hinge sets, a flexible meeting point, and—on most builds—weak internal framing.
      Intruders know this. They target paired doors because the failure points are predictable.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you follow the principles below, double doors can be just as secure as a single solid-core exterior door.
      But you have to reinforce them intentionally, not with cheap cosmetic hardware. Before doing any upgrades,
      check how these doors fit into your overall
      <a href="/home-security/zone-based-security-planning.html">home security zoning</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Secure the Inactive (Fixed) Door First</h2>

    <p>
      One door is “active” — it has the handle and deadbolt.  
      The other is “inactive” — it stays put until you release the internal latches.  
      If the inactive door moves even slightly, the entire system is compromised.
    </p>

    <h3>What You Need</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Top and bottom flush bolts</strong> that seat deep into the frame and threshold.</li>
      <li><strong>Heavy-duty bolts</strong>, not thin decorative ones.</li>
      <li><strong>Long screws</strong> that anchor hardware into the framing studs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The inactive door should feel like part of the wall when locked — no wiggle, no flex.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Install a Full-Length Astragal</h2>

    <p>
      An astragal is the vertical strip that covers the gap between the two doors.  
      Without one, an intruder can slip a pry bar between the doors and push the deadbolt straight out of the strike.
    </p>

    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Covers the seam where pry attacks normally start.</li>
      <li>Prevents spreading the doors apart at the meeting point.</li>
      <li>Provides a backing surface for the deadbolt.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you can see light through the center gap of your double doors, you need an astragal immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Reinforce the Hinge Side</h2>

    <p>
      With two doors, there are usually six hinges instead of three — double the opportunity for failure.
    </p>

    <h3>What to Upgrade</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Security hinges</strong> with non-removable pins.</li>
      <li><strong>3-inch hinge screws</strong> into framing studs.</li>
      <li><strong>Hinge-side reinforcement plates</strong> on vulnerable frames.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Reinforcing both sides prevents an intruder from deciding whether to kick the latch side or attack the hinge side.
      Either way, the door holds.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Strengthen the Deadbolt Setup</h2>

    <p>
      With double doors, the deadbolt relies heavily on the inactive door being rock solid.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use a <strong>Grade 1 deadbolt</strong> for real strength.</li>
      <li>Pair it with a <strong>reinforced strike plate</strong> on the inactive door.</li>
      <li>Ensure the bolt fully throws at least 1 inch into metal-backed material.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If the inactive door has any flex, upgrade the flush bolts before anything else.  
      The deadbolt is only as strong as the panel it anchors into.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Consider Multi-Point Locking Systems</h2>

    <p>
      Higher-end double doors often support multi-point locks — systems that lock the active door at the top,
      center, and bottom simultaneously.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Great for reducing door flex.</li>
      <li>Excellent for resisting pry attacks.</li>
      <li>Often required for large or heavy decorative doors.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your doors already support a multi-point setup, upgrading is one of the strongest improvements you can make.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Improve Lighting and Surveillance</h2>

    <p>
      Double doors are often placed at decorative entries, porches, and patios — areas intruders love because they’re
      semi-hidden. Fix the visibility problem and you cut the risk significantly.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a bright overhead motion light.</li>
      <li>Angle a camera to cover the full width of the doors.</li>
      <li>Keep bushes and décor away from the door line.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For placement rules, check the
      <a href="/home-security/indoor-vs-outdoor-security-cameras.html">camera placement guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Include Alarm Sensors</h2>

    <p>
      Every double-door setup should be tied directly into the alarm system.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contact sensors</strong> on the active door.</li>
      <li><strong>Additional contacts</strong> or <strong>shock sensors</strong> on the inactive door.</li>
      <li>Motion or camera zones watching the entire approach.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A sensor on only one door is not enough — intruders know which panel to attack.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Make Sure the Threshold Isn’t a Weak Spot</h2>

    <p>
      On many double doors, the bottom seam can be pried upward or outward.  
      This is a silent attack that defeats entire door systems if ignored.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use a reinforced threshold with metal backing.</li>
      <li>Ensure flush bolts seat deep into the bottom plate.</li>
      <li>Inspect for rot — soft wood makes reinforcement useless.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If the bottom flexes, replace the threshold before relying on any lock hardware.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Double Doors Can Be Strong — If You Build Them Right</h2>

    <p>
      When reinforced correctly, double doors stop being a liability and become one of the strongest entry points on
      the property. The difference is in the details: solid flush bolts, a full-length astragal, a reinforced frame,
      upgraded hinges, and a proper deadbolt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Follow those principles and you eliminate the pry gap, the flex problem, and the hinge weakness entirely.

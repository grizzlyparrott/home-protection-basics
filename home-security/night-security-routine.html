    <h1>Night Security Routine: The Simple Checklist That Stops Most Problems</h1>

    <p>
      Most break-ins, thefts, and late-night problems come down to unlocked doors, open gates, poor lighting,
      and cameras that aren’t actually pointing where you think they are.  
      A simple nighttime routine eliminates almost all of these issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      This routine takes two minutes, requires no equipment, and dramatically tightens your home’s security by
      removing the “easy opportunities.”  
      Before running it nightly, make sure your exterior layout is solid—use the
      <a href="../home-security/perimeter-security-fundamentals.html">Perimeter Security Guide</a>
      to verify nothing obvious is being missed.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Check All Exterior Doors</h2>

    <p>
      Go door by door and physically try the handle. Don’t just look at it—pull it.
      You’re checking:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Front door</li>
      <li>Back door</li>
      <li>Side garage door</li>
      <li>Garage interior door</li>
      <li>Any basement or patio entries</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If any door feels weak or flexes when pulled, consider reinforcing it using the  
      <a href="../home-security/door-reinforcement-basics.html">Door Reinforcement Basics</a> guide.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Lock Sliding Doors and Windows Facing the Yard</h2>

    <p>
      These openings see the most nighttime probing. Confirm:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Latches are fully engaged</li>
      <li>Security bars, dowels, or track blockers are in place</li>
      <li>Nothing outside provides leverage to pry them open</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For deeper guidance, see  
      <a href="../home-security/sliding-door-security-basics.html">Sliding Door Security Basics</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Confirm All Gates Are Closed and Locked</h2>

    <p>
      Back and side gates are top targets because they control access to dark, hidden areas.
      Make sure:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Gates are latched</li>
      <li>Padlocks are secured (if used)</li>
      <li>No items are nearby that can be used as steps</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you have tools, chairs, or equipment stored outside, review  
      <a href="../home-security/securing-exterior-stored-tools.html">Securing Exterior Stored Tools</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Quick Lighting Check</h2>

    <p>
      A lot of homeowners only realize a bulb is burned out when reviewing footage after an incident.
      Each night:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Look at your front porch light</li>
      <li>Check driveway lights</li>
      <li>Confirm side yard and backyard lights activate</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your yard has dark spots, compare  
      <a href="../home-security/motion-light-vs-dusk-to-dawn.html">Motion vs Dusk-to-Dawn Lighting</a>  
      to decide which solution fits better.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Camera Angle & Feed Check</h2>

    <p>
      You don’t need to watch hours of footage—just a quick glance:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Open your app and confirm cameras are online</li>
      <li>Look at live views for any glare, darkness, or misalignment</li>
      <li>Make sure doors, gates, and vehicles are still in frame</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your cameras regularly lose sightlines, see  
      <a href="../home-security/avoiding-camera-blind-spots.html">Avoiding Camera Blind Spots</a>
      to clean up the angles.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Secure the Garage Area</h2>

    <p>
      Garage intrusions spike at night. Lock down these items:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Close the overhead door fully</li>
      <li>Verify the interior garage door is locked</li>
      <li>Remove tools or ladders visible from outside</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your garage layout has weak points, the  
      <a href="../home-security/garage-door-security-fundamentals.html">Garage Door Security Fundamentals</a>  
      guide covers the most common fixes.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Quick Perimeter Sweep</h2>

    <p>
      You don’t need to patrol the yard—just glance through windows to confirm:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>No unknown vehicles nearby</li>
      <li>No one loitering around access paths</li>
      <li>Gates, sheds, and equipment areas appear normal</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Nighttime Security Checklist</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>All doors physically checked</li>
      <li>Windows and sliders secured</li>
      <li>Gates closed and locked</li>
      <li>Lights operational and covering key angles</li>
      <li>Cameras online and aligned</li>
      <li>Garage fully secured</li>
      <li>No unusual activity outside</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Doing this every night builds a strong routine and eliminates nearly all avoidable risks.
      It’s simple, fast, and far more effective than relying on alarms alone.

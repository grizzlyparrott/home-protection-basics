    <h1>Spotting Surveillance Blind Zones Around Your Home</h1>

    <p>
      Most people assume, “The camera sees this area, so I am covered.” Then something happens and the footage
      shows a car bumper, a blown-out light, or nothing at all. The problem is not always the hardware. It is often
      the blind zones you never tested.
    </p>

    <p>
      This guide walks you through a simple way to find blind zones, fix them, and avoid false confidence in your
      surveillance system. If you have not planned your layout yet, it helps to read the
      <a href="../home-security/camera-placement-guide.html">Camera Placement Guide</a> first so you know what each camera is supposed to cover.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What a Blind Zone Actually Is</h2>

    <p>
      A blind zone is any area where you think you have coverage but do not have reliable, usable footage. It is not
      just “no camera pointed there.” Blind zones include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Areas technically in frame but too far away to identify faces or plates.</li>
      <li>Sections blocked by trees, vehicles, posts, or trim.</li>
      <li>Zones washed out by bright lights or deep shadows.</li>
      <li>Spots that only show up at certain times (like when a car is parked).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The <a href="../home-security/avoiding-camera-blind-spots.html">Avoiding Camera Blind Spots</a> article covers common placement mistakes. Here, you are going to test your current setup the way an intruder would.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Common Causes of Blind Zones</h2>

    <p>
      Most blind zones come from the same handful of problems:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single-angle coverage:</strong> one camera trying to cover too much territory.</li>
      <li><strong>Obstructions:</strong> shrubs, pillars, vehicles, and porch posts blocking lines of sight.</li>
      <li><strong>Backlight and glare:</strong> a light source or bright background behind the subject.</li>
      <li><strong>Poor overlap:</strong> cameras that barely touch each other’s fields instead of overlapping.</li>
      <li><strong>Wrong height:</strong> cameras mounted too high to capture faces, too low to see context.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you are fighting glare, silhouettes, or bright backgrounds, the
      <a href="../home-security/handling-backlight-and-glare.html">Handling Backlight and Glare</a> guide walks through how to aim both lights and cameras so they work together instead of fighting each other.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Walk-Test Your Cameras Like an Intruder</h2>

    <p>
      The fastest way to find blind zones is to put your phone in “live view” and walk the property.
      Do this after dark and during the day.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Open your camera app and watch the live feed from each camera.</li>
      <li>Start at the sidewalk or driveway where someone would approach.</li>
      <li>Walk slowly toward each likely target: doors, windows, vehicles, gates.</li>
      <li>Stop every 3–5 steps, stand still, and see what the camera actually shows.</li>
      <li>Repeat the same route with a hat or hoodie on to see how much detail you lose.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Mark every spot where you cannot clearly see your own face or where you disappear completely. Those are not
      “low priority” areas. Those are the zones someone will use on purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Use Recorded Footage to Spot Real-World Gaps</h2>

    <p>
      Live viewing only shows you ideal conditions. Real incidents happen at bad angles, in bad light, and during
      bad weather. Spend ten minutes reviewing actual recordings:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Look at clips where people walk to your door or across the driveway.</li>
      <li>Pause the footage and ask, “Would I recognize this person if I did not already know them?”</li>
      <li>Check rain, fog, or snow clips if you live in those conditions.</li>
      <li>Review nighttime deliveries and late visitors.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If faces are soft blobs or headlights turn everything into a white cloud, you have lighting and angle issues,
      not just “a cheap camera.” The
      <a href="../home-security/security-lighting-placement.html">Security Lighting Placement</a> guide explains how to fix lighting so your cameras are not constantly fighting glare and hard shadows.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Fixing Blind Zones Without Rebuilding Everything</h2>

    <p>
      You do not always need more cameras. Start with the cheap, easy fixes and only then decide if you need new hardware.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Adjust angles before buying anything.</strong><br>
        Small changes in tilt or rotation can pull more of the approach path into the frame and reduce dead space.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lower or raise the mount.</strong><br>
        If all you see are the tops of heads, the camera is too high. If all you see is chest-level, it may be too low.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trim or move obstructions.</strong><br>
        Shrubs, hanging plants, banners, and stacked items can block more of the frame than you think.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add overlap, not clutter.</strong><br>
        If you add another camera, aim for overlapping coverage at your critical points (doors, vehicles, gates) instead of pointing everything at the same wide area.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fix lighting that ruins your footage.</strong><br>
        Move fixtures, change brightness, or swap beam patterns so you are lighting people, not just a white wall or driveway.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      If you are planning a bigger layout refresh, the
      <a href="../home-security/zone-based-security-planning.html">Zone-Based Security Planning</a> article shows how to build coverage in layers instead of randomly adding more cameras and hoping for the best.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Quick Checklist: Have You Actually Checked Coverage?</h2>

    <p>Run this checklist once now, then again any time you move cameras, change lighting, or remodel.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I have walked my property while watching live camera feeds.</li>
      <li>I know where my image quality drops too low to identify someone.</li>
      <li>I have checked recordings at night, in bad weather, and with car headlights present.</li>
      <li>I adjusted angles and mounts before deciding I “need better cameras.”</li>
      <li>I fixed or reduced glare, backlighting, and harsh shadows as much as possible.</li>
      <li>Critical zones (doors, driveway, gates) have at least some overlapping coverage.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Cameras are not magic. They are just tools. Once you know where they actually see and where they do not,
      you can make honest decisions about whether you are covered—or just hoping you are.

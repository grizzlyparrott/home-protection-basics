    <h1>Securing RV and Boat Parking: Protecting Big Targets in Plain Sight</h1>

    <p>
      RVs, boats, trailers, and other recreational vehicles are prime targets for thieves—they’re valuable, often mobile,
      and usually stored outside where criminals can access them quietly. Most thefts take less than two minutes when the
      vehicle is parked in a predictable, poorly secured spot.
    </p>

    <p>
      This guide covers the exact hardware, placement strategies, and deterrents you need to keep large vehicles safe at
      home. If you're also securing your driveway and garage areas, pair this with
      <a href="/home-security/driveway-camera-positioning.html">Driveway Camera Positioning</a> and
      <a href="/home-security/garage-door-security-fundamentals.html">Garage Door Security Fundamentals</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Park Where Thieves Can’t Maneuver Easily</h2>
    <p>
      Large vehicles need space to move. Reducing maneuvering room is one of the simplest ways to prevent theft.
    </p>

    <h3>Best Parking Positions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Back RVs or trailers tight against a wall or fence.</li>
      <li>Angle the hitch toward the house so it’s harder to connect.</li>
      <li>Place boats with the stern facing outward—motors are harder to access.</li>
      <li>Use wheel chocks that lock in place.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Homeowner Scenario A</h3>
    <p>
      Your utility trailer sits nose-out with the hitch perfectly exposed. A thief can back up, hook it, and be gone in
      seconds. Simply backing the trailer to the fence cuts the theft risk dramatically.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use Real Hitch and Wheel Locks (Not Decorative Ones)</h2>
    <p>
      Cheap hitch locks can be cut in under 10 seconds with small bolt cutters. You need locks designed for resistance.
    </p>

    <h3>Best Lock Types</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Heavy-duty bulldog hitch lock:</strong> Covers the entire coupler.</li>
      <li><strong>Wheel boot:</strong> Immobilizes the vehicle entirely.</li>
      <li><strong>Receiver lock:</strong> Prevents thieves from inserting their own hitch gear.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Use more than one lock type. Redundancy increases time—and thieves hate time.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Light the Parking Area Properly</h2>
    <p>
      Large vehicles cast huge shadows. Your lighting setup needs to remove those blind pockets.
    </p>

    <h3>Lighting Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a wide-angle dusk-to-dawn light to illuminate the vehicle’s perimeter.</li>
      <li>Add a motion light aimed along the driveway approach path.</li>
      <li>Avoid placing lights directly behind the vehicle—this blinds cameras.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Pair this with the lighting tactics in 
      <a href="/home-security/security-lighting-placement.html">Security Lighting Placement</a> for best results.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Use Cameras That Cover Approach Paths, Not Just the Vehicle</h2>
    <p>
      Cameras pointed at RVs and boats only record the theft after it starts. You want cameras that capture the approach.
    </p>

    <h3>Camera Placement Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mount 8–9 feet high on the house, not the RV.</li>
      <li>Aim at the driveway, gate, or alley entrance.</li>
      <li>Add a secondary camera watching the hitch or stern area.</li>
      <li>Avoid aiming directly into headlights of vehicles approaching.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Secure the Parking Area Itself</h2>
    <p>
      Even if the vehicle is secured, the area around it should be difficult to access.
    </p>

    <h3>Area Reinforcement Options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Install a <strong>locking gate</strong> or <strong>bollards</strong> to restrict vehicle movement.</li>
      <li>Use <strong>gravel</strong> or <strong>noisy surfaces</strong> thieves hate walking on.</li>
      <li>Fence off the parking zone with privacy panels to break sightlines.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Homeowner Scenario B</h3>
    <p>
      A boat sits behind a simple chain-link gate with no lock. Adding a $20 heavy-duty gate lock and a wheel boot makes
      the theft not worth the trouble.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Hide or Remove High-Value Components</h2>
    <p>
      Thieves sometimes steal parts instead of the vehicle itself.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Targets</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Outboard motors</li>
      <li>Propellers</li>
      <li>Batteries</li>
      <li>Electronics</li>
      <li>Portable generators</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Remove these items or lock them inside the garage or a reinforced shed.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Final 5-Minute RV/Boat Security Audit</h2>
    <p>
      Walk around your setup and confirm:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The hitch is blocked or turned inward.</li>
      <li>At least one hitch lock and one wheel lock are installed.</li>
      <li>The vehicle cannot be easily maneuvered.</li>
      <li>Lighting covers the entire perimeter.</li>
      <li>Cameras capture the approach path clearly.</li>
      <li>High-value components are removed or locked.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      With the right positioning, locks, and visibility, RV and boat theft becomes dramatically harder—and your big
      investments stay exactly where you left them.

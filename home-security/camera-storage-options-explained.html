    <h1>Camera Storage Options Explained: Cloud, SD Cards, and NVRs</h1>

    <p>
      Cameras record footage, but where that footage goes determines how useful it is.  
      If storage fails, the camera may as well be a prop. You need a setup that’s reliable, cost-efficient,
      and accessible when you actually need the footage.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you haven’t set up your camera layout yet, start with the  
      <a href="/home-security/camera-placement-guide.html">Camera Placement Guide</a>.  
      No storage system compensates for bad placement.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Cloud Storage: Convenient but Dependent on the Cloud</h2>

    <p>
      Cloud storage uploads your camera clips or continuous video to a remote server.  
      It’s simple, automatic, and accessible from anywhere—but only if your internet holds up.
    </p>

    <h3>Pros</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy access from phone or computer.</li>
      <li>Footage is safe even if the camera is stolen.</li>
      <li>No hardware to maintain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Monthly subscription fees.</li>
      <li>Uploads fail if Wi-Fi drops or is weak.</li>
      <li>Slow upload speeds limit video quality.</li>
      <li>Clips may not upload in time during heavy activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Cloud works best for doorbell cams and small wireless systems—not full property coverage.
    </p>

    <h2>2. SD Card Storage: Local but Vulnerable</h2>

    <p>
      Many cameras include SD card slots. Footage stays in the camera itself with no subscription required.
      But if someone steals the camera, the footage goes with it.
    </p>

    <h3>Pros</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No subscription cost.</li>
      <li>Good for isolated cameras or backup recording.</li>
      <li>Easy to set up—insert card and go.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Camera theft = lost footage.</li>
      <li>Cards wear out over time and need replacement.</li>
      <li>Limited storage capacity compared to NVR systems.</li>
      <li>Slow to review large amounts of footage.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      SD storage is best as a secondary system or for low-risk areas—not your main security record.
    </p>

    <h2>3. NVR Storage (Network Video Recorder): The Most Reliable Option</h2>

    <p>
      NVRs store footage from wired PoE cameras on a dedicated hard drive.  
      This is the professional-grade option and the only system that consistently holds up under real security demands.
    </p>

    <h3>Pros</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Continuous 24/7 recording.</li>
      <li>No internet required for recording.</li>
      <li>High bitrate and high-resolution footage.</li>
      <li>Large storage capacity (days to months).</li>
      <li>Footage stays onsite even if cameras are tampered with.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Requires cable runs and a PoE switch.</li>
      <li>More upfront cost.</li>
      <li>NVR theft risk if not secured or hidden.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you want the system you don’t have to babysit, NVR + PoE cameras is the top choice.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Hybrid Systems: The Best of Both Worlds</h2>

    <p>
      Many homeowners use hybrid setups—for example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>NVR for main perimeter cameras.</li>
      <li>Cloud backups for doorbell or garage cams.</li>
      <li>SD cards as redundancy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Hybrid systems reduce failure points and give you backup if one storage type fails.
    </p>

    <h2>5. How Much Storage Do You Actually Need?</h2>

    <p>
      Storage requirements depend on resolution, frame rate, and recording mode.
    </p>

    <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1080p cameras:</strong> 8–12 GB per day per camera (continuous).</li>
      <li><strong>1440p / 2K:</strong> 12–20 GB per day per camera.</li>
      <li><strong>4K:</strong> 25–50 GB per day per camera.</li>
      <li><strong>Motion-only setups:</strong> 50–80% less storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A 2–6 TB NVR drive usually covers 2–8 weeks for most homes.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Which Storage Option Should You Choose?</h2>

    <p>
      Short answer:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>NVR</strong> if you want reliability and full coverage.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud</strong> if you use wireless cameras and don’t mind subscriptions.</li>
      <li><strong>SD cards</strong> only as backups or for low-risk areas.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Storage determines whether your cameras are just blinking lights or a real security tool.
      Pick the system that matches how much you actually care about keeping the footage.

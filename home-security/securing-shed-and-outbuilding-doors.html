    <h1>Securing Shed and Outbuilding Doors: Stop Easy Access to Your Tools</h1>

    <p>
      Sheds and outbuildings are the softest targets on any property.  
      They’re lightly built, poorly lit, and usually far from the home—exactly what intruders want.  
      If you store tools, ladders, bikes, fuel, or equipment in a shed, securing it is non-negotiable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before adding hardware, read the  
      <a href="/home-security/high-risk-entry-point-analysis.html">Entry Point Risk Analysis</a>  
      so you understand why outbuildings rank high on the vulnerability list.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Upgrade the Door Structure First</h2>

    <p>
      Most shed doors are thin plywood or lightweight panels held together with staples or short screws.  
      If the door breaks before the lock does, the lock was pointless.
    </p>

    <h3>Structural Fixes That Matter</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Replace short screws with 2–3 inch exterior screws.</li>
      <li>Add a horizontal brace across the inside of the door.</li>
      <li>Replace weak panels with 3/4" plywood if the door flexes.</li>
      <li>Strengthen the frame with angle brackets or metal reinforcement plates.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The door should not flex when you push on it. If it moves, reinforce it.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use a Real Locking System (Not a Cheap Latch)</h2>

    <p>
      Shed locks are typically decorative. Intruders open them with one pry attempt.  
      Replace them with hardware designed to resist force.
    </p>

    <h3>Recommended Locking Options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Heavy-duty hasp + padlock</strong> (shielded or shrouded).</li>
      <li><strong>Bar-style door lock</strong> that spans the entire width.</li>
      <li><strong>Deadbolt kit</strong> if the door is thick enough for one.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Shielded padlocks prevent bolt cutters from getting leverage—don’t use an open-shackle lock.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Reinforce the Hinge Side</h2>

    <p>
      Cheap hinges are one of the biggest outbuilding weaknesses.  
      Many are mounted with exposed screws that can be removed in seconds.
    </p>

    <h3>Fix the Hinge Vulnerability</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use carriage bolts instead of screws to prevent tampering.</li>
      <li>Install security hinges with non-removable pins.</li>
      <li>Add a hinge-side latch or security pin so the door stays locked even if hinges are removed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Add Lighting and Visibility</h2>

    <p>
      Sheds are almost always in dark corners, behind fences, or near the back of the yard.  
      That’s why intruders love them.
    </p>

    <h3>Lighting Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Install a motion light aimed at the door.</li>
      <li>Illuminate the approach path, not just the structure.</li>
      <li>Avoid placing bright lights behind the camera to prevent glare.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Use the  
      <a href="/home-security/camera-placement-guide.html">Camera Placement Guide</a>  
      if adding cameras.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Use Interior Security Upgrades</h2>

    <p>
      Even if the exterior fails, interior systems can still stop or document the intrusion.
    </p>

    <h3>Interior Add-Ons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contact sensor</strong> on the door tied to your alarm or standalone siren.</li>
      <li><strong>Battery-powered siren</strong> that activates on door opening.</li>
      <li><strong>Interior camera</strong> if the shed has power or solar options.</li>
      <li><strong>GPS trackers</strong> hidden on expensive equipment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Secure the Inside Layout</h2>

    <p>
      Make it harder for thieves to grab things quickly.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lock high-value tools to an anchor point inside.</li>
      <li>Store heavy equipment far from the door.</li>
      <li>Avoid leaving bolt cutters or pry bars inside (don’t give them tools).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Anchor the Entire Structure If Necessary</h2>

    <p>
      Lightweight prefab sheds can be tipped, lifted, or moved.  
      If the floor isn’t anchored, all other security upgrades become irrelevant.
    </p>

    <h3>Anchoring Options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ground anchors screwed into soil.</li>
      <li>Bolts into concrete pads.</li>
      <li>Metal anchors tied to the frame.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. The Goal: Delay and Detection</h2>

    <p>
      You’re not building a fortress—you’re buying time and visibility.  
      A reinforced door, real hasp, strong hinges, and lighting turn a shed from a 10-second break-in to a loud, risky,
      frustrating target. That alone makes thieves move on.

    <h1>Safe Parking Security Basics: Keeping Your Vehicles and Driveway Protected</h1>

    <p>
      Driveways are one of the easiest areas for thieves to exploit. Vehicles are often left unlocked,
      valuables sit in plain view, and the driveway itself becomes an access path toward the garage or side yard.
      Securing the area is simple once you understand where the risks actually come from.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you haven't evaluated the visibility of your street or driveway yet, the
      <a href="../home-security/evaluating-neighborhood-risk.html">Neighborhood Risk Guide</a>
      can help you identify whether your area attracts opportunistic activity.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Keep Your Vehicle Locked Every Time</h2>

    <p>
      This sounds obvious, yet a huge percentage of driveway thefts happen because someone simply
      tries a door handle and finds it open. Lock the vehicle every single time—even if it’s “just for a minute.”
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Enable auto-lock if your vehicle supports it.</li>
      <li>Double-check latching sounds before walking away.</li>
      <li>Make locking part of your nighttime security routine.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your nighttime routine is weak, use the  
      <a href="../home-security/night-security-routine.html">Night Security Routine</a>  
      to tighten it up.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Remove or Hide All Visible Valuables</h2>

    <p>
      Thieves often don’t target the vehicle—they target what's inside:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Wallets, bags, backpacks</li>
      <li>Loose cash or change</li>
      <li>Electronics and chargers</li>
      <li>Tools or work equipment</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Even empty bags attract attention because thieves assume there’s something inside.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Light the Driveway Correctly</h2>

    <p>
      Good lighting does more to stop driveway theft than most alarms. Your lighting should:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Create clear visibility from the street and house.</li>
      <li>Avoid shining directly into cameras.</li>
      <li>Cover approach paths from the sidewalk and side yards.</li>
      <li>Stay consistent—no burned-out bulbs or dead zones.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For guidance on which lighting type is best, see  
      <a href="../home-security/motion-light-vs-dusk-to-dawn.html">Motion vs Dusk-to-Dawn Lighting</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Use Cameras to Cover the Approach Angle</h2>

    <p>
      A camera pointed directly at a parked vehicle only captures part of the story.  
      You want to monitor:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The sidewalk-side approach</li>
      <li>Driveway entry and exit paths</li>
      <li>Any blind zones created by vehicles</li>
      <li>Garage and side yard access routes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your camera angles keep missing activity, use  
      <a href="../home-security/avoiding-camera-blind-spots.html">Avoiding Camera Blind Spots</a>  
      to fix the sightlines.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Park Smart: Angle and Position Matter</h2>

    <p>
      The way you park can either make theft easier or force someone into full view.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Park closer to the house where lighting is better.</li>
      <li>Avoid leaving large gaps between cars—you create hiding spots.</li>
      <li>Back in if it increases visibility from the street or windows.</li>
      <li>Turn wheels toward the curb to deter towing or rolling theft.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Secure the Garage and Nearby Areas</h2>

    <p>
      Many thieves target vehicles to test whether the garage is accessible.  
      Install habits such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Making sure the overhead door fully closes</li>
      <li>Locking the interior garage door every night</li>
      <li>Not leaving garage remotes in vehicles</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For deeper protection, see the  
      <a href="../home-security/garage-door-security-fundamentals.html">Garage Door Security Fundamentals</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Catalytic Converter Theft Prevention</h2>

    <p>
      This type of theft happens fast—under 90 seconds in most cases. Reduce risk by:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Parking near walls or tight spaces to block access underneath</li>
      <li>Using driveway lighting to make hiding harder</li>
      <li>Adding catalytic shields or cages if theft is common in your area</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Quick Driveway Security Checklist</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Vehicle locked, every time</li>
      <li>No valuables visible</li>
      <li>Driveway well-lit</li>
      <li>Cameras covering approach angles</li>
      <li>Garage secured and closed</li>
      <li>No tools or objects left out that could aid a break-in</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Driveway crime is opportunistic. If you remove the easy opportunities, thieves move on quickly.  
      A few simple habits make your driveway—and your vehicle—much harder to target.

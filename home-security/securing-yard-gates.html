    <h1>Securing Yard Gates: Closing the Easiest Access Point</h1>

    <p>
      Yard gates are one of the most predictable failure points in home security. They’re usually old, sagging, or held
      shut with the flimsiest latch in the entire property. Intruders know this. A weak side gate gives them access to
      the backyard—exactly where they want to be: out of sight of neighbors, cameras, and the street.
    </p>

    <p>
      This guide covers the exact hardware, angles, and structural fixes that turn a flimsy gate into an actual barrier.
      If you are also working on perimeter visibility, pair this with
      <a href="/home-security/security-lighting-placement.html">Security Lighting Placement</a> and
      <a href="/home-security/spotting-surveillance-blind-zones.html">Spotting Surveillance Blind Zones</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Identify the Weak Point: Latch, Hinges, or Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Yard gates almost always fail in one of three places:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The latch:</strong> too small, too loose, or easy to pop with a screwdriver.</li>
      <li><strong>The hinges:</strong> sagging or secured with short screws that pull out easily.</li>
      <li><strong>The fence structure:</strong> rotten posts or vinyl panels that flex instead of resisting force.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Homeowner Scenario A</h3>
    <p>
      Your gate “closes,” but the latch doesn’t actually catch unless you push it hard. An intruder can slip a flathead
      between the post and the gate and pop it open in seconds. This is extremely common with older wood gates.
    </p>

    <h3>Simple Diagnostic Test</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Grab the top of the gate and shake it inward and outward.</li>
      <li>If the gate moves more than 1 inch, hinges or the post are failing.</li>
      <li>If the latch wiggles or doesn’t fully seat, it will not resist prying.</li>
      <li>If you can slip two fingers between the gate and frame, an intruder can slip tools in as well.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Upgrade the Latch: Use Heavy Hardware</h2>
    <p>
      Most factory latches are decorative at best. Replace them with something designed for real resistance.
    </p>

    <h3>Best Gate Latch Options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Locking gravity latch:</strong> simple, reliable, and resistant to casual prying.</li>
      <li><strong>Barrel bolt + padlock:</strong> best for side gates you rarely use.</li>
      <li><strong>Keyed gate lock:</strong> ideal for front-facing gates with frequent use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Installation Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mount the latch hardware using <strong>3-inch exterior screws</strong> that bite into the fence post, not just the slat.</li>
      <li>Position the latch on the inside so it cannot be reached from outside the gate.</li>
      <li>Ensure the strike plate aligns perfectly—poor alignment is why gates “bounce” instead of locking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Reinforce the Hinges and Gate Frame</h2>
    <p>
      Hinges are often easier to attack than latches. Strengthening them closes a common gap.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Reinforce Hinges</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Replace all hinge screws with <strong>3-inch deck screws</strong> for deeper bite.</li>
      <li>If the gate sags, install an <strong>anti-sag kit</strong> using a tension cable and corner brackets.</li>
      <li>Add a second hinge for heavy wood gates to prevent twist and tear-out.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Homeowner Scenario B</h3>
    <p>
      Your hinges are tight, but the post itself is rotten. The gate feels secure, but a strong shove flexes the entire
      structure. Fixing the post is the only real fix. Reinforcing hardware won’t help if the foundation is weak.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Reduce Visibility and Hand Reach</h2>
    <p>
      The less an intruder can see or reach through the gate, the harder it is to bypass.
    </p>

    <h3>Easy Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a <strong>privacy slat</strong> or board if the gate has large gaps.</li>
      <li>Install <strong>anti-reach plates</strong> on the latch side.</li>
      <li>Ensure no cutouts or dog windows allow hands to slip through.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Add Lighting and Cameras Strategically</h2>
    <p>
      A side gate is a high-value camera location, but placement matters.
    </p>

    <h3>Lighting Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a motion light aimed <strong>down the length of the side yard</strong>, not toward the camera.</li>
      <li>Avoid mounting it over the gate—this creates glare and shadows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Camera Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mount the camera <strong>8–9 feet</strong> high on the house side, not the gate side.</li>
      <li>Aim the camera along the path, not at the gate head-on.</li>
      <li>Use narrow motion zones to reduce false alerts from wind or animals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Lock It When You're Away</h2>
    <p>
      If you travel frequently, a padlocked gate is a cheap and effective deterrent. Most intruders skip properties with
      locked side access because it adds time and noise.
    </p>

    <h3>Simple Travel Checklist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Padlock the side gate.</li>
      <li>Check lighting and cameras.</li>
      <li>Ensure hinges and latches are tight.</li>
      <li>Remove items intruders could stand on (buckets, bins, chairs).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once your side gate is reinforced, intruders lose the easiest shortcut to the backyard—and you remove a major blind
      spot in your home’s security perimeter.

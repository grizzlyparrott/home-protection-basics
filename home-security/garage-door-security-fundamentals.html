    <h1>Garage Door Security Fundamentals: Closing the Biggest Residential Weak Point</h1>

    <p>
      Garage doors are one of the largest, weakest, and most commonly exploited entry points on a home. They’re big, loud,
      and look secure—but most can be popped, lifted, or bypassed in under 10 seconds using tricks intruders already know.
    </p>

    <p>
      This guide breaks down the major risks and the exact steps to harden your garage door. If you’re reinforcing the
      full perimeter, pair this with 
      <a href="/home-security/hardening-detached-structures.html">Hardening Detached Structures</a> and
      <a href="/home-security/securing-yard-gates.html">Securing Yard Gates</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Fix the Emergency Release Vulnerability</h2>
    <p>
      The emergency release cord is the biggest garage door security flaw. Intruders slip a coat hanger through the top
      gap, hook the release lever, and pull—disengaging the opener so the door can be lifted manually.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Fix It</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Zip-tie the emergency release lever in place (still functional during emergencies).</li>
      <li>Trim or remove the dangling red emergency cord.</li>
      <li>Install a <strong>Release Shield</strong> to block hanger access entirely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Homeowner Scenario A</h3>
    <p>
      Your garage faces the street. A thief can park across from your home, slip a hanger through the gap, and bypass your
      entire system silently. A $10 zip tie eliminates the vulnerability instantly.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Reinforce the Door Panels</h2>
    <p>
      Many garage doors are thin aluminum that can be bent by hand near the bottom. Adding reinforcement prevents pry
      attacks.
    </p>

    <h3>Reinforcement Options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a <strong>garage door reinforcement bar</strong> across the center panel.</li>
      <li>Use <strong>inside-mounted angle brackets</strong> to stiffen weak panels.</li>
      <li>Install vertical struts on older doors that flex easily.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Secure the Manual Side Door</h2>
    <p>
      Many attached and detached garages have a side door made of thin wood with cheap hardware. This is usually the real
      break-in point—not the overhead door.
    </p>

    <h3>Fix the Side Door Weakness</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a <strong>solid-core door</strong> (not hollow).</li>
      <li>Add a <strong>deadbolt</strong> with a reinforced strike plate.</li>
      <li>Replace hinge screws with 3-inch exterior screws.</li>
      <li>Install a door reinforcement plate to prevent kick-ins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Homeowner Scenario B</h3>
    <p>
      An intruder bypasses the overhead door entirely and kicks in the side door in seconds. Reinforcing the door with a
      $15 strike plate and long screws would have stopped it cold.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Eliminate Easy Lift Points</h2>
    <p>
      Even if the opener is engaged, intruders test the bottom of the door to see if it lifts with force.
    </p>

    <h3>Testing for Weak Lift Points</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Grab the bottom section and pull upward firmly.</li>
      <li>If you feel movement or flex, reinforce that section.</li>
      <li>Check for worn weather stripping or gaps big enough for pry bars.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a <strong>bottom door bracket reinforcement</strong>.</li>
      <li>Install <strong>heavy-duty weather stripping</strong> to reduce pry access.</li>
      <li>Use <strong>concrete anchors</strong> for garage doors on uneven pads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Lighting and Camera Coverage</h2>
    <p>
      Garages need both lighting and cameras—especially if they face the street.
    </p>

    <h3>Lighting Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a wide-angle dusk-to-dawn light over the garage entry.</li>
      <li>Angle lights downward to avoid blinding cameras.</li>
      <li>Light both the driveway and the walkway leading to the side door.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Camera Placement</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mount cameras 8–9 feet high on the eaves or wall.</li>
      <li>Aim one at the driveway and vehicle path.</li>
      <li>Aim another at the garage side door if present.</li>
      <li>Avoid placing cameras directly under the light source.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>

      <a href="/home-security/driveway-camera-positioning.html">Driveway Camera Positioning</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Secure Tools and Entry Aids Inside the Garage</h2>
    <p>
      If someone does get inside your garage, they shouldn’t find tools that help them break into your home.
    </p>

    <h3>Secure These Items</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ladders (to prevent window or roof access).</li>
      <li>Hammers, pry bars, or bolt cutters.</li>
      <li>Power tools that can cut locks or hinges.</li>
      <li>Keys kept on hooks near the interior door.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Anchor down valuable equipment or store it inside the house when possible.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Final 5-Minute Garage Security Check</h2>
    <p>
      Walk through your garage and confirm:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emergency release can’t be hooked from outside.</li>
      <li>Panels don’t flex when pushed.</li>
      <li>Side door is solid-core and reinforced.</li>
      <li>No tools are lying around that help intruders.</li>
      <li>Lighting covers both doors.</li>
      <li>Cameras are angled correctly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once reinforced, your garage stops being a soft target and becomes one of the most secure parts of the home
      exterior.

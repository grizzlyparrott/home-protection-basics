    <h1>Fire Safety for Renters: What You Must Check Immediately</h1>

    <p>
      Renters depend on the building owner for structural fire safety, but day-to-day risk control is entirely yours. 
      That means verifying alarms, exits, and electrical safety instead of assuming the landlord handled it. If kids live 
      with you, review the 
      <a href="/fire-safety/children-and-fire-safety-basics.html">children and fire safety basics</a> 
      too—they need clear rules.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Smoke Alarms: Confirm Function, Placement, and Age</h2>

    <p>
      Do not trust that your landlord tested anything. Verify it yourself.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Test every smoke alarm the day you move in.</li>
      <li>Smoke alarms should be on every level, in hallways, and inside bedrooms.</li>
      <li>Replace batteries immediately if the test is weak.</li>
      <li>Check alarm age—units older than 10 years should be replaced.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Follow the routine from your 
      <a href="/fire-safety/alarm-testing-schedule.html">alarm testing schedule</a> 
      so detectors work year-round.
    </p>

    <h2>2. CO Detectors: Mandatory if You Have Gas Appliances</h2>

    <p>
      Any rental with a gas furnace, gas stove, or attached garage must have CO detectors.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Test CO detectors the same day you move in.</li>
      <li>Place them outside sleeping areas.</li>
      <li>Request replacements if they fail, are missing, or are older than seven years.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Learn Every Exit—Not Just the Front Door</h2>

    <p>
      Renters often get trapped because they rely on one exit path. Know all options.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Identify two escape routes from every bedroom.</li>
      <li>Confirm windows actually open and aren’t painted shut.</li>
      <li>Avoid blocking exits with furniture, storage bins, or décor.</li>
      <li>Know the building’s exterior stairwells and emergency exits.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Pair this with the 
      <a href="/fire-safety/home-fire-escape-plan-checklist.html">escape plan checklist</a> 
      so your routines stay consistent.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Cords, Outlets, and Overloaded Circuits</h2>

    <p>
      Landlords rarely monitor outlet wear or circuit loads. You must.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Replace damaged cords and avoid daisy-chaining power strips.</li>
      <li>Keep extension cords temporary—never permanent.</li>
      <li>Spread out high-watt appliances across multiple circuits.</li>
      <li>Watch for warm outlets, flickering lights, or scorched plates.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you decorate seasonally, follow the 
      <a href="/fire-safety/holiday-fire-safety-basics.html">holiday fire safety basics</a> 
      so lights and cords don’t overload circuits.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Kitchen Fire Safety in Rentals</h2>

    <p>
      The kitchen is where most rental fires start, often from unattended cooking or poor layout.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Keep flammable items off counters near burners.</li>
      <li>Never leave frying food unattended.</li>
      <li>Clean grease regularly from stoves and hood vents.</li>
      <li>Use correct extinguishers—review 
        <a href="/fire-safety/fire-extinguisher-types-and-uses.html">extinguisher types and uses</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Space Heaters: High Risk in Small Rentals</h2>

    <p>
      Rentals often rely on space heaters in cold months. These need strict rules.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Three-foot clearance on all sides—no exceptions.</li>
      <li>Only use heaters with tip-over shutoff protection.</li>
      <li>Plug directly into a wall outlet—never extension cords.</li>
      <li>Turn heaters off when sleeping or leaving the room.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Multi-Unit Building Hazards</h2>

    <p>
      In apartments, someone else’s mistakes become your problem.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Monitor hallways for clutter that can block exits.</li>
      <li>Report malfunctioning emergency lights or alarms immediately.</li>
      <li>Know the building’s fire extinguisher locations.</li>
      <li>Stay aware of neighbors using candles or smoking indoors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. What Landlords Are Generally Responsible For</h2>

    <p>
      Laws vary by state, but landlords typically must:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Provide functioning smoke and CO detectors.</li>
      <li>Maintain heating equipment and keep it safe.</li>
      <li>Fix faulty wiring and outlets.</li>
      <li>Ensure emergency exits are accessible and operational.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You handle the daily risks—they handle the structural ones.
    </p>

    <h2>9. What Renters Need to Avoid Completely</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Blocking exits with furniture or storage</li>
      <li>Running extension cords under carpets</li>
      <li>Leaving candles unattended—see 
        <a href="/fire-safety/candle-safety-guidelines.html">candle safety guidelines</a>
      </li>
      <li>Disabling smoke alarms because of false alarms</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If alarms false frequently, address it properly using 
      <a href="/fire-safety/reducing-false-smoke-alarms.html">reducing false smoke alarms</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Quick Renter Fire Safety Checklist</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>All alarms tested and working</li>
      <li>Two exits identified from every room</li>
      <li>Outlets and cords in good condition</li>
      <li>Kitchen fire safety rules followed</li>
      <li>Space heaters used correctly</li>
      <li>CO detectors installed if required</li>
      <li>Nothing blocking hallways or exits</li>
    </ul>

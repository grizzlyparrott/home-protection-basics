    <h1>Wildfire Evacuation Basics: Leaving Fast and Clean</h1>

    <p>
      When a wildfire gets close, hesitation kills time and time kills options. Evacuation isn’t about staying calm—
      it’s about being fast, efficient, and already knowing what to do. If you’ve already set up defensible space around
      your home using the <a href="/fire-safety/wildfire-defensible-space-basics.html">wildfire defensible space guide</a>,
      this page covers the next step: getting out before conditions trap you.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Leave Early—Not When the Fire Is on Your Street</h2>

    <p>
      Wildfire evacuation levels exist for a reason. Don’t wait until flames are visible. Once smoke thickens or winds
      shift, roads clog immediately. Leave early if:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your area enters a “Level 2 / Get Set” warning.</li>
      <li>You have pets, children, elderly family, or mobility issues.</li>
      <li>You can smell smoke strongly inside the house.</li>
      <li>The power fails or cell reception degrades unexpectedly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Early evacuation avoids panic traffic and reduces the chance of being redirected into unsafe routes.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Quick Home Prep Before You Go</h2>

    <p>
      A few fast actions can help your home survive embers and radiant heat.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Shut all windows, doors, and garage doors tightly.</li>
      <li>Turn off gas to the house if accessible and safe to do.</li>
      <li>Move flammable outdoor items away from walls and decks.</li>
      <li>Shut interior doors to slow interior fire spread.</li>
      <li>Leave lights on so firefighters can see the structure through smoke.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you store anything hazardous in the garage, confirm it’s secured. Follow the same principles used in
      <a href="/fire-safety/flammable-liquid-storage-basics.html">flammable liquid storage</a> so vapors and loose containers don’t add fuel.
    </p>

    <h2>3. What to Take (Only the Essentials)</h2>

    <p>
      Wildfire evacuations are about speed, not packing. Take what matters and nothing that slows you down.
    </p>

    <h3>Required</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Wallet, ID, cash, and essential paperwork</li>
      <li>Prescriptions and medical devices</li>
      <li>Phones, chargers, and backup battery banks</li>
      <li>Pet carriers, leashes, and food</li>
      <li>One change of clothes per person</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Nice-to-Have (If There’s Time)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hard drives, laptops, or irreplaceable documents</li>
      <li>Fireproof safe contents, if portable</li>
      <li>Small valuables you can grab instantly</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If it requires thinking, searching, or deciding, skip it. Seconds matter.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Vehicle Prep Before You Roll Out</h2>

    <p>
      Your vehicle is your exit plan—set it up properly.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Keep your gas tank at least half-full during fire season.</li>
      <li>Park facing the road for a forward exit.</li>
      <li>Clear ash from the windshield before driving.</li>
      <li>Turn headlights on even in daylight for visibility.</li>
      <li>Avoid driving through heavy smoke—visibility drops instantly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Know Multiple Routes</h2>

    <p>
      Fires don’t care about your preferred road. Have three options:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Primary route:</strong> Fastest paved road out of the area.</li>
      <li><strong>Secondary route:</strong> Alternate paved road in case of closure.</li>
      <li><strong>Last-resort route:</strong> A drivable back road or rural exit if the fire blocks main roads.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Avoid canyons, narrow roads, and routes that funnel you toward vegetation-heavy areas.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Never Assume Authorities Will Knock on Your Door</h2>

    <p>
      Fire crews are stretched thin. Do not wait for a personal notification. If official evacuation orders hit your area,
      leave immediately. If you have kids at home, make sure they know evacuation rules by reviewing
      <a href="/fire-safety/teaching-kids-fire-escape-basics.html">basic fire escape basics for children</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>7. What Not to Do</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Don’t try to “hold the line” with a garden hose.</li>
      <li>Don’t stay behind to protect property—structures can be rebuilt, you cannot.</li>
      <li>Don’t re-enter evacuation zones without clearance.</li>
      <li>Don’t park in areas that could block emergency crews.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Fire grows faster than you can react. Respect the speed of the threat.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Reentry After the Fire</h2>

    <p>
      Only return once authorities say it’s safe. When you go back:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Watch for hotspots and smoldering materials.</li>
      <li>Check roofs, attics, and gutters for embers.</li>
      <li>Document any home damage immediately for insurance.</li>
      <li>Inspect siding, decks, and vents for heat damage.</li>
    </ul>

      If you live in wildfire country, turn this into a full household plan. Start with
      <a href="/fire-safety/home-fire-escape-plan-checklist.html">building a tested fire escape plan</a>
      so every family member knows what to do when the call to evacuate comes.

    <h1>Children and Fire Safety Basics: Teaching Safe Behavior Early</h1>

    <p>
      Kids don’t naturally understand fire danger. They learn it, and they learn it from you. Open flames, hot appliances, 
      candles, and lighters look harmless to a child until something ignites. Teach these rules early and repeat them often. 
      If you haven’t built a family escape routine yet, review the 
      <a href="/fire-safety/home-fire-escape-plan-checklist.html">home fire escape plan checklist</a> first.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What Children Need to Know About Fire</h2>

    <p>
      Kids should know three basic facts:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fire is fast—smoke and flames spread quicker than adults can react.</li>
      <li>Heat and smoke rise—crawling low is safer than standing.</li>
      <li>They never hide during fires—they get out and stay out.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These rules eliminate the most dangerous child behaviors during real fire events.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Matches, Lighters, and Ignition Sources Stay Locked Down</h2>

    <p>
      If kids can reach ignition sources, they will eventually play with them. Lock them away.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Store matches and lighters out of reach and out of sight.</li>
      <li>Use child-resistant lighters and keep spares locked up.</li>
      <li>Never leave lit candles unattended—review the 
        <a href="/fire-safety/candle-safety-guidelines.html">candle safety guidelines</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Teach kids that “fire tools” are adult-only items, not toys.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Stove and Kitchen Heat Safety</h2>

    <p>
      The kitchen creates more burn injuries than any other part of the home.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Kids stay at least three feet from the stove—always.</li>
      <li>Turn pot handles inward so kids can’t grab them.</li>
      <li>Never allow children to play on the kitchen floor during cooking.</li>
      <li>Keep flammable décor and towels away from burners.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you use the oven or stovetop heavily during holidays, review 
      <a href="/fire-safety/holiday-fire-safety-basics.html">holiday fire safety basics</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Teaching Children About Alarms</h2>

    <p>
      Kids must know that alarms aren’t optional—they mean move now.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Let kids hear the smoke alarm so they recognize the sound.</li>
      <li>Teach them to stop what they’re doing and go directly to the exit.</li>
      <li>Show them where to meet outside—every time.</li>
      <li>Reinforce that alarms are never ignored or silenced without checking.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Make sure your detectors work—follow the 
      <a href="/fire-safety/alarm-testing-schedule.html">testing schedule</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Safe Behavior Around Heaters and Fireplaces</h2>

    <p>
      Portable heaters and fireplaces are irresistible to kids. Set strict boundaries:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Three-foot “no-play zone” around all heaters.</li>
      <li>Use screens on fireplaces and fire pits.</li>
      <li>Never leave children alone with active flames or heaters.</li>
      <li>Keep toys, blankets, and clothes well away from heating equipment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you use a fireplace, review 
      <a href="/fire-safety/fireplace-maintenance-basics.html">fireplace maintenance basics</a>
      so sparks and creosote issues don’t add risk.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Practice the Fire Drill With Them</h2>

    <p>
      Kids perform how they practice. Walk through the same steps you expect them to take during a real emergency.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Show the exit paths clearly.</li>
      <li>Have them crawl low under imaginary smoke.</li>
      <li>Practice touching doors with the back of their hand before opening.</li>
      <li>Reinforce the outdoor meeting point every time.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Low-pressure repetition builds instinctive behavior when alarms sound.
    </p>

    <h2>7. What Children Should Never Do During a Fire</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Never hide under beds or in closets.</li>
      <li>Never go back inside for toys, electronics, or pets.</li>
      <li>Never try to fight a fire themselves.</li>
      <li>Never open hot doors—find another exit.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These rules save more lives than any equipment you can buy.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Quick Child Fire Safety Checklist</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Matches and lighters locked away</li>
      <li>Candles controlled or replaced with LED</li>
      <li>Kitchen stay-back rules enforced</li>
      <li>Kids know alarm sounds and escape routes</li>
      <li>Fireplace and heaters have clear boundaries</li>
      <li>Smoke and CO alarms tested regularly</li>
    </ul>

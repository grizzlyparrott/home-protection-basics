    <h1>Smoke Crawling Technique Basics: How to Move Safely Through a House Fire</h1>

    <p>
      Smoke kills faster than flames. In most fatal home fires, people never make it out because they inhaled toxic smoke
      or got disoriented and collapsed. Smoke crawling is how you survive long enough to reach an exit. If you haven’t
      already chosen your primary escape routes, review the
      <a href="/fire-safety/identifying-primary-exits.html">primary exit guide</a>
      before practicing this technique.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Why Crawling Works: Smoke Behavior in a House Fire</h2>

    <p>
      Heat and smoke rise. Toxic gases form a thick ceiling layer that drops lower by the second. Staying upright puts
      your head directly into the deadliest air in the building.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Freshest air stays near the floor.</li>
      <li>Visibility improves drastically at ground level.</li>
      <li>Heat intensity drops the closer you are to the ground.</li>
      <li>Crawling prevents collapse from inhalation or heat shock.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If smoke is already below four feet, you should be crawling—no exceptions.
    </p>

    <h2>2. The Correct Body Position</h2>

    <p>
      Not all crawls are equal. The right technique keeps your face low without slowing you down.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hands and knees:</strong> faster, works for mild smoke conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Elbow-and-knee crawl:</strong> gets your face even lower for heavier smoke.</li>
      <li><strong>Belly crawl:</strong> lowest and safest option in zero visibility or extreme heat.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Practice all three so you can switch automatically when conditions change.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How to Stay Oriented While Crawling</h2>

    <p>
      Smoke blinds you fast. The biggest risk is losing your direction entirely.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Keep one hand on the wall as a guide.</li>
      <li>Move in a straight line whenever possible.</li>
      <li>Count doorways or landmarks during practice drills.</li>
      <li>Never stand up to “get your bearings”—stay low and keep moving.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Walls and baseboards become your map when visibility disappears.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Crawling Through Doorways Safely</h2>

    <p>
      Doorways expose you to sudden heat and smoke flow if the fire is on the other side.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Feel the door with the back of your hand before opening.</li>
      <li>Open slowly and keep your face low.</li>
      <li>Use the door as temporary cover as you peek underneath for smoke levels.</li>
      <li>Switch to belly crawling if smoke is pouring in.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This technique gives you a split second to react to changing fire conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Crawling Through Hallways</h2>

    <p>
      Hallways fill with smoke first and become the hottest part of the escape route.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use the wall with your guiding hand.</li>
      <li>Stay centered vertically between floor and wall base.</li>
      <li>Move quickly—hallways become flashover channels.</li>
      <li>Turn only when you feel the junction, not by guessing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Crawling With Children or Mobility-Limited Adults</h2>

    <p>
      In real fires, you may need to assist someone while crawling.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Hold children's hands and guide them behind you.</li>
      <li>Use clothing or blankets to pull small kids if needed.</li>
      <li>For adults, assign a helper and practice two-person movement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For mobility-specific planning, see the
      <a href="/fire-safety/mobility-limited-escape-plans.html">mobility-limited guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Quick Smoke Crawling Checklist</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Crawl immediately when smoke drops below standing height</li>
      <li>Choose the crawl style based on visibility</li>
      <li>Use walls for orientation</li>
      <li>Clear doorways cautiously</li>
      <li>Move fast through hallways</li>
      <li>Assist kids and dependents without standing up</li>
    </ul>

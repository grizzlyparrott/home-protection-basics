    <h1>Multi-Family Fire Safety Basics: Essential Rules for Apartments & Shared Buildings</h1>

    <p>
      Fire spreads differently in multi-unit buildings because of shared walls, ventilation paths, stacked units, and
      common entry points. Your safety depends not just on your own habits but on your neighbors’ choices too. This guide
      shows the rules that matter most. If you haven’t already built a monthly routine, check the 
      <a href="/fire-safety/fire-safety-checkup-routine.html">fire safety checkup routine</a>
      before finalizing your building plan.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Know Every Exit—Not Just the One You Use Daily</h2>

    <p>
      People die in apartment fires because they panic and run toward the familiar exit, even when it’s blocked.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Find every stairwell, not just the closest one.</li>
      <li>Locate fire doors and understand where they lead.</li>
      <li>Never depend on elevators—smoke disables them quickly.</li>
      <li>Walk both exit routes once so they’re burned into memory.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In larger buildings, exits often look “hidden” behind utility doors—know them early.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Understand Your Building’s Alarm System</h2>

    <p>
      Some buildings use full-building alarms; others use unit-level alarms only.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>If alarms are interconnected, treat every activation as real.</li>
      <li>If only your unit alarms, smoke may already be inside.</li>
      <li>Never disable beeping alarms—replace batteries immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For alarm upkeep, follow the 
      <a href="/fire-safety/alarm-testing-schedule.html">regular testing schedule</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Watch for Hazards Coming From Adjacent Units</h2>

    <p>
      You can’t control your neighbors, but you can monitor warning signs.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Smelling constant smoke or burning odors through vents</li>
      <li>Hearing electrical popping or buzzing through walls</li>
      <li>Seeing extension cords running under doors into hallways</li>
      <li>Noticing clutter or debris in shared hallways</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Report these issues to management—the risks compound across multiple units.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Keep Shared Hallways and Stairwells Clear</h2>

    <p>
      Hallway clutter becomes deadly in seconds during an evacuation.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>No shoes, boxes, or storage outside units</li>
      <li>No bicycles blocking stairwells</li>
      <li>No furniture in common hallways</li>
      <li>No doormats in narrow corridors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These items fuel hallway fires and block escape paths.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Understand How Smoke Moves in Multi-Unit Buildings</h2>

    <p>
      In apartments, smoke spreads upward and sideways through every weak point.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ventilation ducts shared between units</li>
      <li>Cracks around plumbing and exhaust chases</li>
      <li>Gaps under fire doors</li>
      <li>Stairwells that act as chimneys</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If smoke is entering your unit, close doors and vents—then follow 
      <a href="/fire-safety/smoke-barrier-basics.html">smoke barrier basics</a>
      to slow spread while you evacuate.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Know When to Evacuate vs. Shelter in Place</h2>

    <p>
      The correct action depends on fire location and smoke conditions.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Evacuate:</strong> smoke in hallway, heat on your door, fire below your floor.</li>
      <li><strong>Shelter:</strong> hallway impassable, smoke heavy outside your door.</li>
      <li><strong>Move:</strong> to a room with a window for firefighter access.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If sheltering, seal gaps with wet towels and signal responders from the window.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Never Prop Open Fire Doors</h2>

    <p>
      Fire doors stop smoke spread. Propping them open defeats the entire system.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Close fire doors behind you when evacuating.</li>
      <li>Report propped doors to management immediately.</li>
      <li>Educate neighbors who don’t understand the risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Kitchen and Heating Safety Still Apply</h2>

    <p>
      Fire risk inside your unit is the same as a standalone home.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Unattended cooking is still the top ignition source.</li>
      <li>Space heaters still need three feet of clearance.</li>
      <li>Candles are still high-risk—follow the 
        <a href="/fire-safety/candle-safety-guidelines.html">candle safety guidelines</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Multi-unit buildings add complexity but don’t change the basics.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Quick Multi-Family Safety Checklist</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Two exit routes known</li>
      <li>Hallways clear</li>
      <li>Alarms functional</li>
      <li>Kitchen hazards controlled</li>
      <li>Heaters spaced correctly</li>
      <li>Smoke barriers ready</li>
      <li>Plan for evacuation and shelter-in-place</li>
    </ul>

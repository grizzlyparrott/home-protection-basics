    <h1>Wildfire Defensible Space Basics: Creating a Buffer That Protects Your Home</h1>

    <p>
      Wildfires spread by consuming fuel—dry grass, shrubs, trees, fencing, mulch, and even the home’s exterior. Defensible
      space reduces that fuel and slows the fire long enough for firefighters to defend your property or for the fire to
      pass without reaching your structures. If you haven’t built your evacuation plan yet, read the
      <a href="/fire-safety/wildfire-evacuation-basics.html">wildfire evacuation basics</a> afterward.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Understand the Three Defensible Space Zones</h2>

    <p>
      Each zone has specific requirements and exists to slow fire as it approaches.
    </p>

    <h3>Zone 0: Immediate Zone (0–5 feet)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove all combustible materials—mulch, wood chips, firewood, stored items.</li>
      <li>Use gravel or hardscape instead of vegetation.</li>
      <li>Keep gutters, roofs, and vents clear of leaves and debris.</li>
      <li>Trim branches away from the house and roofline.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Zone 1: Intermediate Zone (5–30 feet)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain short, well-watered grass.</li>
      <li>Prune shrubs regularly and keep them spaced apart.</li>
      <li>Break up vegetation clusters to reduce fire spread.</li>
      <li>Tree limbs should be at least 6–10 feet off the ground.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Zone 2: Extended Zone (30–100+ feet)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Thin or remove small trees and brush.</li>
      <li>Keep space between tree crowns to prevent laddering.</li>
      <li>Reduce dead vegetation, fallen branches, and leaf litter.</li>
      <li>Maintain wider spacing on slopes where fire travels uphill faster.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Remove Fuel Sources Before Fire Season</h2>

    <p>
      Firefighters look for homes that are easy to defend—don’t leave fuel lying around.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Clear dry grass, weeds, and brush early in the season.</li>
      <li>Dispose of debris far from the home.</li>
      <li>Move firewood piles at least 30 feet away.</li>
      <li>Replace flammable fencing near the home with metal or composite materials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Build a Fire-Resistant Landscape</h2>

    <p>
      Landscaping choices can slow or accelerate wildfire spread.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use nonflammable mulch like gravel near structures.</li>
      <li>Plant low-resin, fire-resistant shrubs and groundcovers.</li>
      <li>Keep plants short and well-maintained.</li>
      <li>Avoid dense, oily plants that burn aggressively.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Vegetation isn’t the enemy—unmanaged vegetation is.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Maintain Trees to Prevent Fire Laddering</h2>

    <p>
      Ladder fuels allow fire to climb from ground to canopy.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Remove lower branches up to 6–10 feet.</li>
      <li>Thin tree clusters so crowns don’t touch.</li>
      <li>Remove dead trees, hanging branches, and downed logs.</li>
      <li>Keep trees at least 10 feet from structures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Harden the Home Exterior</h2>

    <p>
      Even with defensible space, wind-blown embers can ignite your home.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Install ember-resistant vent screens.</li>
      <li>Seal gaps in siding, roofing, and decks.</li>
      <li>Use Class A fire-rated roofing when possible.</li>
      <li>Replace old, flammable decks with composite or metal materials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Keep Access Paths Clear for Firefighters</h2>

    <p>
      Fire crews need room to maneuver and defend your home.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ensure driveways support emergency vehicles.</li>
      <li>Trim overgrown trees along access roads.</li>
      <li>Clearly mark your address at the road.</li>
      <li>Maintain turnarounds if you live in rural areas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Quick Defensible Space Checklist</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Zone 0 cleared completely</li>
      <li>Zone 1 vegetation maintained and spaced</li>
      <li>Zone 2 thinned and reduced</li>
      <li>No wood piles near the house</li>
      <li>Home exterior hardened</li>
      <li>Firefighter access maintained</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Escape Ladder Use Basics: How to Deploy One Safely</h1>

    <p>
      Portable escape ladders give you a second exit when your primary route is blocked by smoke or flames. They only help 
      if you know how to deploy and descend them correctly. If you haven't practiced escape movements recently, review the 
      <a href="/fire-safety/home-fire-drill-guide.html">home fire drill guide</a> first so ladder use fits smoothly into your plan.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Choose the Right Ladder for Your Home</h2>

    <p>
      Ladders aren't universal—pick the correct size and design before an emergency.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use a ladder rated for your home’s height (two-story or three-story models).</li>
      <li>Ensure it supports the weight of adults and children—check weight ratings.</li>
      <li>Pick a model with anti-slip rungs and stabilizers.</li>
      <li>Store it in the room where it will be used, not in a hallway.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your home has upper-level bedrooms, every one should have a ladder or a clear alternate exit.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Window Preparation: Make Sure It Can Actually Open</h2>

    <p>
      A ladder is useless if the window doesn’t open fully.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Test all designated escape windows twice a year.</li>
      <li>Remove screens quickly—practice this step.</li>
      <li>Make sure windows aren’t painted shut or blocked by furniture.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Poor window access slows everything down during a real emergency.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Proper Ladder Attachment</h2>

    <p>
      The ladder must hook securely to the window sill before you put weight on it.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Place the hooks firmly over the sill—verify they sit flat and don’t slide.</li>
      <li>Check that the sill is sturdy enough to support full load weight.</li>
      <li>Keep the ladder centered so weight distributes evenly.</li>
      <li>Push the ladder outward so it drops fully before climbing.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Never climb until the ladder is fully extended and stable.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Descending Safely</h2>

    <p>
      Controlled movement is everything.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Face the ladder while descending—never face outward.</li>
      <li>Keep three points of contact at all times.</li>
      <li>Move slowly and deliberately.</li>
      <li>Do not overload the ladder—one person at a time.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If children must descend, an adult should go first if possible to help from below.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Avoid Dangerous Ladder Misuse</h2>

    <p>
      Certain actions turn an escape ladder into a hazard.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Do not anchor ladders to furniture—it will tip.</li>
      <li>Do not jump onto the ladder from inside the room.</li>
      <li>Do not climb with pets or objects in hand.</li>
      <li>Do not use ladders on windows above obstacles like shrubs or AC units.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Your descent path should be clear from top to bottom.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Practice Deployment (Without Climbing)</h2>

    <p>
      You should practice hooking and lowering the ladder so you know the motions. 
      Do not practice climbing unless manufacturer instructions allow it.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Attach ladder to sill and confirm stability.</li>
      <li>Lower it fully and evaluate drop path.</li>
      <li>Reset and store compactly for real emergencies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Familiarity reduces panic and speeds up deployment time.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Integrate Ladders Into Your Escape Plan</h2>

    <p>
      Ladders aren’t standalone tools—they’re part of a larger escape strategy.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Assign each room its primary and secondary exit.</li>
      <li>Place ladders where occupants can reach them fast.</li>
      <li>Include ladder deployment in fire drills.</li>
      <li>Ensure the outdoor meeting point is reachable after descent.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your escape plan involves smoke-heavy hallways, review the
      <a href="/fire-safety/smoke-barrier-basics.html">smoke barrier basics</a>
      so you can contain smoke long enough to reach the window.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Quick Escape Ladder Checklist</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Ladder rated for your home’s height</li>
      <li>Stored in the correct room</li>
      <li>Window accessible and easy to open</li>
      <li>Sill strong enough for load weight</li>
      <li>Ladder deployed and stable before climbing</li>
      <li>One person descending at a time</li>
      <li>Outdoor path clear of hazards</li>
    </ul>

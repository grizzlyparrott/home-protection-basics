  <h1>72-Hour Survival Basics: What You Need Ready Before Anything Happens</h1>

  <p>
    The first 72 hours after a disaster are usually on you, not 911. Power can be out, stores closed, roads blocked, and help
    delayed. A basic 3-day setup gives your household water, calories, light, communication, and sanitation without needing
    a single trip to the store.
  </p>

  <p>
    This isn’t long-term “off-grid” prepping. It’s the minimum level of readiness every normal household should aim for.
    If you want a more detailed shopping list by category, pair this with the
    <a href="/emergency-prep/basic-home-emergency-kit-list.html">Basic Home Emergency Kit List</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Water: The One Thing You Can’t Fake</h2>

  <p>
    Plan for at least one gallon of water per person per day. That covers drinking, basic hygiene, and a little cooking.
    For a family of four, that’s 12 gallons for a full 72-hour window. Store it in sealed containers that can sit in a closet
    or under a bed without being knocked over or punctured.
  </p>

  <p>
    On top of stored water, you want a way to make questionable water safer if the outage runs longer than expected. A
    compact filter or purification tablets are enough for most households. For a deeper dive on options, see
    <a href="../emergency-prep/emergency-water-filtration-basics.html">Emergency Water Filtration Basics</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Food That Survives a Power Outage</h2>

  <p>
    Don’t overcomplicate food. You need shelf-stable calories that can be eaten cold if the power and gas are off:
    canned soups and stews, beans, tuna, peanut butter, granola bars, nuts, crackers, and ready-to-eat meals. Focus on
    foods your family will actually eat, not just what looks “survival themed” on a label.
  </p>

  <p>
    Aim for 1,500–2,000 calories per adult per day and a bit less for kids. Rotate these items into normal use every few
    months and replace them so your kit doesn’t slowly turn into a box of expired cans.
    If you want to cook during outages instead of eating everything cold, read
    <a href="../emergency-prep/emergency-cooking-basics.html">Emergency Cooking Basics</a>
    for safe burner and fuel options.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Light and Backup Power</h2>

  <p>
    Moving around in the dark is how people trip, fall, and walk into broken glass or debris. At minimum, your 72-hour setup
    should include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>One headlamp per adult so hands stay free</li>
    <li>At least one small lantern for lighting a room</li>
    <li>A basic flashlight as backup</li>
    <li>Enough batteries or a way to recharge via power bank</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Small USB power banks can keep phones, radios, and lights running through a short outage. For a closer look at battery,
    solar, and plug-in options that scale beyond three days, see
    <a href="../emergency-prep/backup-lighting-options.html">Backup Lighting Options</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Communication When Cell Service Is Spotty</h2>

  <p>
    Cell networks are often overloaded or partially down right when you need them most. That’s why a basic emergency radio
    is part of a 72-hour setup. A compact battery-powered or hand-crank radio lets you hear weather alerts, evacuation
    orders, and local status updates even when your phone is useless.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside the household, simple tools like a whistle, notepad, and marker can help coordinate between family members and
    neighbors. For a more detailed breakdown of how to stay informed and reachable, see
    <a href="../emergency-prep/communication-during-emergencies.html">Communication During Emergencies</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Medical and Personal Essentials</h2>

  <p>
    A 72-hour setup doesn’t require a full trauma kit, but it does need enough to handle normal injuries and short
    disruptions in access to care:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Assorted bandages and sterile gauze</li>
    <li>Medical tape and disposable gloves</li>
    <li>Antiseptic wipes or solution</li>
    <li>Pain relievers and any daily medications</li>
    <li>Basic allergy meds that your household tolerates</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If anyone in the home depends on medication, store at least a small buffer of doses in your kit and rotate it regularly
    so it doesn’t expire unnoticed.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Sanitation and Trash Control</h2>

  <p>
    Short-term emergencies still create a lot of waste: food packaging, wipes, tissues, and potentially human waste if water
    service is disrupted. Your 72-hour setup should include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Heavy trash bags and smaller bathroom-size bags</li>
    <li>Disposable gloves</li>
    <li>Hand sanitizer and cleaning wipes</li>
    <li>A small amount of toilet paper and paper towels</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Even in a three-day window, poor sanitation can turn minor cuts into infections fast. For more detail on handling
    bathroom needs and waste if services are offline longer, see
    <a href="../emergency-prep/emergency-sanitation-basics.html">Emergency Sanitation Basics</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Clothing, Shelter, and Comfort Items</h2>

  <p>
    Most people ride out short emergencies at home, but temperatures can swing hard if the grid is down. Pack layers that
    match your climate: warm socks, hoodies, lightweight rain gear, and blankets. If you live in an extreme heat or cold
    region, building out dedicated setups from
    <a href="../emergency-prep/extreme-heat-prep-basics.html">Extreme Heat Prep Basics</a>
    and
    <a href="../emergency-prep/extreme-cold-prep-basics.html">Extreme Cold Prep Basics</a>
    is worth the extra effort.
  </p>

  <p>
    For households with kids, add simple comfort items—snacks they like, a few toys, and a small flashlight they can control.
    That keeps stress lower when everything else already feels abnormal.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Documents and Cash</h2>

  <p>
    Even for a 72-hour event, having copies of key documents in one place saves time and stress: IDs, insurance details,
    key phone numbers, and medical information. Store them in a waterproof folder or pouch alongside a small amount of
    cash in small bills.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want a more deliberate strategy for where to keep cash, how much to hold, and how to avoid theft, read
    <a href="../emergency-prep/emergency-cash-storage-basics.html">Emergency Cash Storage Basics</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Quick 72-Hour Checklist</h2>

  <p>
    If you want the bare-bones version, a functional 72-hour setup usually includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Enough water for three days (1 gallon per person per day) plus a basic filter</li>
    <li>Shelf-stable food that doesn’t require cooking</li>
    <li>Headlamps, a lantern, and spare batteries or a power bank</li>
    <li>An emergency radio and a way to charge phones</li>
    <li>A small but real first-aid kit and needed medications</li>
    <li>Trash bags, wipes, sanitizer, and minimal paper products</li>
    <li>Season-appropriate clothing and blankets</li>
    <li>Copies of key documents and some cash</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Once those boxes are checked, you’re past “totally unprepared” and into “realistically ready” for most short-term
    emergencies. From there, you can expand into more detailed plans for specific threats like floods, earthquakes, or
    wildfires.

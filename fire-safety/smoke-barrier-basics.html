    <h1>Smoke Barrier Basics: Slowing Smoke Spread During a Fire</h1>

    <p>
      Smoke kills faster than flames. Thick, hot smoke reduces visibility, irritates airways, and fills hallways long before
      fire reaches them. Smoke barriers exist to slow that spread. Using doors, vents, and simple improvised barriers buys
      escape time. If your household hasn’t practiced evacuation recently, review the 
      <a href="/fire-safety/home-fire-drill-guide.html">home fire drill guide</a>
      before relying on memory during a real emergency.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Closed Doors Are the Most Effective Smoke Barrier</h2>

    <p>
      A closed door can delay smoke spread for minutes—sometimes long enough for escape or rescue.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Close bedroom doors before sleeping.</li>
      <li>Close doors behind you when evacuating.</li>
      <li>Do not rely on hollow-core doors for long delays—use time wisely.</li>
      <li>Teach children not to open doors with heat on the handle or surface.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Fire departments rely on closed doors to limit damage and buy survival time.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Ventilation Control: Stop Smoke From Being Pulled Into Rooms</h2>

    <p>
      HVAC systems move air throughout the home—air movement means smoke movement.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Turn off HVAC systems immediately during a fire.</li>
      <li>Close interior vents if smoke is entering rooms.</li>
      <li>Block floor vents with towels if smoke travels through ductwork.</li>
      <li>Do not rely on bathroom fans—they pull air and smoke toward them.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      HVAC systems can rapidly spread smoke from one room to the entire structure. Manual shutoff matters.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Improvised Smoke Barriers: Simple but Effective</h2>

    <p>
      When smoke leaks under doors or around frames, simple materials slow the flow.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Wet towels placed along the door bottom</li>
      <li>Damp blankets pressed against gaps</li>
      <li>Covering vents with thick cloth or sweaters</li>
      <li>Taping edges if smoke leakage is heavy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These aren’t long-term solutions—they’re time-buyers until escape or rescue.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Creating Safe Zones When You Can’t Evacuate</h2>

    <p>
      If escape paths are blocked, you need a temporary shelter-in-place strategy.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Pick a room with a window for potential rescue.</li>
      <li>Close the door and block gaps with wet towels.</li>
      <li>Open the window slightly to vent smoke outward.</li>
      <li>Signal responders with a flashlight or visible object.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Safe zones are a last resort, not a primary fire plan. Always attempt evacuation first.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Hallway and Stairwell Smoke Behavior</h2>

    <p>
      Smoke flows upward and fills stairwells quickly. Treat them as danger zones.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Crawl low in hallways to stay below the smoke layer.</li>
      <li>Avoid upstairs hallways if smoke is rising from below.</li>
      <li>Use windows for escape if upper exits are blocked.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your home has multiple floors, review 
      <a href="/fire-safety/escape-ladder-use-basics.html">escape ladder basics</a>
      so upper-level exits stay viable.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Smoke Spread Myths to Ignore</h2>

    <p>
      Several common assumptions are wrong and dangerous:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>“Smoke alarms detect smoke everywhere instantly.” False—alarms detect smoke where they’re installed.</li>
      <li>“I’ll see the fire before smoke becomes dangerous.” False—smoke becomes lethal before flames are visible.</li>
      <li>“Open windows help.” False—windows pull smoke toward the opening.</li>
      <li>“Fans clear smoke.” False—fans increase airflow and spread smoke faster.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Trust physics, not myths—smoke moves quickly and unpredictably.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Quick Smoke Barrier Checklist</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Doors closed before sleeping</li>
      <li>Doors closed behind during evacuation</li>
      <li>HVAC turned off immediately</li>
      <li>Vents closed or blocked</li>
      <li>Gaps sealed with wet towels or blankets</li>
      <li>Safe zone prepared if escape blocked</li>
      <li>Smoke alarms tested regularly</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>Teaching Kids Fire Escape Basics: What They Must Know</h1>

  <p>
    Kids don’t rise to the occasion in a fire—they fall back on whatever you’ve drilled into them.
    They need a few simple rules, repeated until they’re automatic: hear the alarm, get out, go to the meeting spot, and never go back inside.
  </p>

  <p>
    Build your overall layout first using the
    <a href="../fire-safety/home-fire-escape-plan-checklist.html">Home Fire Escape Plan Checklist</a>,
    then use this guide to translate that plan into kid-level instructions.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Start With One Simple Message</h2>

  <p>
    The core rule for kids is straightforward:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>If the smoke alarm beeps, get out and go to the meeting place.</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Don’t start with worst-case horror stories. Start with:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>“If you hear this sound, it means we leave the house fast.”</li>
    <li>“We don’t look for toys, we don’t hide, we just go.”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If they’re nervous about alarms, let them hear a test tone first—covered in the
    <a href="../fire-safety/alarm-testing-schedule.html">Alarm Testing Schedule</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Show Them the Escape Routes, Don’t Just Talk About Them</h2>

  <p>Walk them through their actual paths:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>From bed to bedroom door</li>
    <li>From bedroom to main exit (front or back door)</li>
    <li>Backup route through a window if the hallway is blocked</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Use phrases they’ll remember: “Bed, door, outside” instead of long explanations.
  </p>

  <p>
    For two-story homes, tie this to the
    <a href="../fire-safety/two-story-escape-strategies.html">Two-Story Escape Strategies</a>
    so they know how upper-floor exits work.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Teach “Don’t Hide, Don’t Go Looking”</h2>

  <p>
    In real fires, kids often hide in closets, under beds, or behind furniture because they’re scared.
    You have to overwrite that instinct.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Tell them clearly: <strong>“Firefighters can’t help you if they can’t see you.”</strong></li>
    <li>Practice leaving the room immediately instead of ducking into hiding spots</li>
    <li>Explain that no toy, pet, or device is worth going back for</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Reinforce: once they’re out, they stay out—no re-entry for any reason.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Practice Crawling Low Under “Smoke”</h2>

  <p>
    Kids remember actions better than lectures. Practice:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Crawling on hands and knees from bed to the door</li>
    <li>Staying low along walls in hallways</li>
    <li>Feeling the door with the back of their hand before opening</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Explain the rule: “Smoke goes up, clean air stays low—so we crawl.”
  </p>

  <h2>5. Make the Meeting Place Non-Negotiable</h2>

  <p>
    Your outdoor meeting point is where you count heads and tell firefighters if anyone is missing.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Pick one spot: tree, mailbox, specific corner, or lamppost</li>
    <li>Show them physically where to stand</li>
    <li>Practice walking there from different exits</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Connect this with any broader neighborhood concerns using
    <a href="../home-security/evaluating-neighborhood-risk.html">Evaluating Neighborhood Risk</a>
    if needed.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Run Short, Calm Drills</h2>

  <p>
    Drills don’t need sirens and shouting. You’re training a routine, not panic.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Start with daytime drills: “Let’s pretend the alarm went off. Show me what you do.”</li>
    <li>Later, do low-key nighttime drills without scaring them</li>
    <li>Time each drill and show them they can beat their previous time</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For night-specific adjustments, especially for heavy sleepers, use
    <a href="../fire-safety/nighttime-fire-escape-planning.html">Nighttime Fire Escape Planning</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Adjust for Age and Ability</h2>

  <p>
    Younger kids and kids with mobility or sensory issues will need extra help:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Assign an adult or older sibling to assist specific children</li>
    <li>Keep bedroom doors easy to open from the inside</li>
    <li>Make sure they can reach window locks if that’s part of the plan</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Combine this with the broader
    <a href="../guides/children-home-safety-checklist.html">Children’s Home Safety Checklist</a>
    for non-fire hazards.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Simple Rules Kids Should Be Able to Repeat</h2>

  <p>By the end of your training, they should be able to say:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>“When I hear the alarm, I get out and go to our meeting place.”</li>
    <li>“I don’t hide from smoke or fire.”</li>
    <li>“I don’t go back inside for toys, pets, or anything.”</li>
    <li>“I crawl low if there’s smoke.”</li>
    <li>“I know two ways out of my room.”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If they can say it clearly, and they’ve walked it a few times, they’re far more likely to do it when it’s real.

    <h1>Apartment Fire Escape Guide: How to Evacuate Safely in a Multi-Unit Building</h1>

    <p>
      Apartment fires behave differently than single-family home fires. Smoke spreads vertically, stairwells become
      chimneys, and blocked hallways are common. Your escape plan must account for these limits before an emergency
      happens. If you haven’t already reviewed building-wide risks, read the
      <a href="/fire-safety/multi-family-fire-safety-basics.html">multi-family fire safety basics</a>
      first.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Know Every Exit—Not Just the Front Door</h2>

    <p>
      Apartments typically have two exit routes: your primary route and a secondary stairwell.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Identify both stairwells on your floor.</li>
      <li>Walk each path once so it’s familiar.</li>
      <li>Check for fire doors and ensure they’re never propped open.</li>
      <li>Never plan to use elevators during a fire—they shut down or trap smoke quickly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Check Conditions Before Opening Your Door</h2>

    <p>
      The hallway may already be full of smoke, and opening your door blindly is a major mistake.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use the back of your hand to check door and handle heat.</li>
      <li>Look under the door for visible smoke flow.</li>
      <li>Open the door slowly while staying behind it as a shield.</li>
      <li>If thick smoke rushes in, close the door immediately and switch to a shelter-in-place plan.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For controlling smoke entry, review
      <a href="/fire-safety/smoke-barrier-basics.html">smoke barrier basics</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Move Low and Stay Near Walls in Hallways</h2>

    <p>
      Smoke in hallways collects fast and blinds people instantly.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Crawl low where air is clearer.</li>
      <li>Follow the wall with one hand so you don’t lose direction.</li>
      <li>Move past other units quickly—doors may fail as fire inside grows.</li>
      <li>Commit to your chosen exit; do not turn back unless absolutely blocked.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If smoke is heavy from the start, drop and crawl immediately—no hesitation.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Understand When to Use Stairs and When Not To</h2>

    <p>
      Stairs are your lifeline, but only if they’re safe.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Enter stairwells cautiously—heat rises and may make upper levels unsafe.</li>
      <li>If the stairwell is clear, descend immediately and don’t stop.</li>
      <li>If smoke is pouring upward, consider switching to a different exit route.</li>
      <li>Never go to the roof unless your building explicitly designates it as an evacuation area.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Know When to Shelter Instead of Evacuate</h2>

    <p>
      In some apartment fires, the hallway is worse than your unit. Sheltering temporarily may save your life.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Close your door and all interior doors.</li>
      <li>Seal gaps with towels or clothing.</li>
      <li>Move to a window or balcony for fresh air.</li>
      <li>Call 911 and give your exact unit number and location.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is a last-resort option—not a replacement for evacuation.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Have a Nighttime-Ready Plan</h2>

    <p>
      Apartment fires frequently happen when people are asleep.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Test smoke alarms monthly using the
        <a href="/fire-safety/alarm-testing-schedule.html">testing schedule</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Keep a clear path from bed to door.</li>
      <li>Know which stairwell you’ll use in the dark.</li>
      <li>Wake children immediately and move together.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Combine this with the 
      <a href="/fire-safety/nighttime-fire-escape-planning.html">nighttime escape planning guide</a>
      for a full after-dark strategy.
    </p>

    <h2>7. If You Live Above the Ground Floor, Plan Window Backup Options</h2>

    <p>
      Windows are a secondary exit only when stairs are completely unsafe.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Know which windows face firefighters’ access routes.</li>
      <li>Ensure windows open easily and aren’t painted shut.</li>
      <li>Use balconies if available—they provide safer air and visibility.</li>
      <li>Never jump from upper floors unless absolutely unavoidable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Quick Apartment Fire Escape Checklist</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Two exit routes known and walked</li>
      <li>Door heat and smoke checked before opening</li>
      <li>Hallway movement kept low and direct</li>
      <li>Stairwells evaluated for heat and smoke</li>
      <li>Shelter-in-place backup plan ready</li>
      <li>Nighttime escape obstacles cleared</li>
      <li>Meeting point established outside</li>
    </ul>

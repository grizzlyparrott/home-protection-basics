    <h1>Fire Extinguisher Maintenance Basics: How to Keep Your Extinguisher Ready to Use</h1>

    <p>
      A fire extinguisher that isn’t maintained might as well be empty. Pressure drops, valves clog, and dry chemical
      agents settle into clumps over time. Monthly checks take less than a minute and make the difference between stopping 
      a fire early or losing control of it. If you’re not sure which extinguisher types belong in which rooms, review 
      <a href="/fire-safety/fire-extinguisher-types-and-uses.html">extinguisher types and uses</a> first.
    </p>

    <h2>1. The Two Checks You Must Do Every Month</h2>

    <p>Every extinguisher needs two quick inspections:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pressure gauge:</strong> Needle must sit in the green zone. Any drop means failure risk.</li>
      <li><strong>Physical condition:</strong> Look for dents, corrosion, cracks, or missing tamper seals.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If either check fails, replace or service the extinguisher immediately—don’t gamble with downtime.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Know the Replacement Timeline</h2>

    <p>
      Extinguishers don’t last forever. Most follow these rules:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>10–12 years:</strong> Typical replacement age for standard home units.</li>
      <li><strong>After any use:</strong> Even a one-second discharge requires full recharge or replacement.</li>
      <li><strong>When corrosion appears:</strong> Rust compromises pressure integrity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Old extinguishers may look fine and still fail instantly during use.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Don’t Store Extinguishers in the Wrong Places</h2>

    <p>Placement determines whether you can actually use the extinguisher during a fire.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Keep them visible—never behind clutter, furniture, or appliances.</li>
      <li>Mount them near exits so you have a clear escape route.</li>
      <li>Avoid extreme heat (garages in summer) or freezing conditions (unheated sheds).</li>
      <li>Do not store extinguishers on the floor—moisture and corrosion increase there.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Fire grows fast. You need the extinguisher accessible within seconds.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Shake Dry Chemical Extinguishers Twice a Year</h2>

    <p>
      Dry chemical agents can cake at the bottom of the cylinder, especially in older units.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Pick up the extinguisher and shake it firmly.</li>
      <li>Flip it upside down and shake again.</li>
      <li>You should feel the powder shift inside—if it doesn’t, replace it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Caked agent means the extinguisher won’t discharge properly.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Inspect the Hose and Nozzle</h2>

    <p>Blockages are more common than people realize.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Look for cracks, splits, or brittle spots.</li>
      <li>Check the nozzle for debris or cobwebs.</li>
      <li>Make sure the hose connection is tight and undamaged.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A clogged nozzle makes the extinguisher useless even if pressure is perfect.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Wall Mounts Matter More Than People Think</h2>

    <p>
      Extinguishers thrown into closets or cabinets get buried. Wall mounts fix that problem.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Mount extinguishers 3.5–5 feet above the floor.</li>
      <li>Keep them near room exits, never deep inside the hazard area.</li>
      <li>Ensure the mount is tight—loose mounts create fall damage.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Proper mounting eliminates fumbling and speeds up response.
    </p>

    <h2>7. When to Replace Instead of Repair</h2>

    <p>Repair is rarely worth it for home-grade extinguishers. Replace when:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The gauge reads empty or drifts repeatedly.</li>
      <li>The cylinder shows dents, rust, or bulging.</li>
      <li>The tamper seal is missing without explanation.</li>
      <li>The hose is cracked or the nozzle blocked.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Replacement is cheap compared to the cost of a house fire.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Quick Fire Extinguisher Maintenance Checklist</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Gauge in green zone</li>
      <li>No dents, rust, or cracks</li>
      <li>Hose and nozzle clear</li>
      <li>Dry chemical shaken twice yearly</li>
      <li>Unit mounted and accessible</li>
      <li>Not expired or used</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Smoke Detector Placement Guide: Where They Must Go</h1>

    <p>
      Smoke detectors only work as intended when they are installed in the correct locations. Placement affects detection speed,
      which directly affects escape time during a fire. This guide covers the standard installation points, spacing rules, and
      common mistakes that reduce protection in real homes.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Required Locations in Every Home</h2>
    <p>
      Most fire codes and safety standards agree on the same essential locations. These positions provide early detection for
      sleeping areas and primary movement paths.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inside Every Bedroom:</strong> Required because closed doors delay smoke travel.</li>
      <li><strong>Outside Sleeping Areas:</strong> Hallways that connect bedrooms should have a dedicated detector.</li>
      <li><strong>Each Level of the Home:</strong> Including basements and finished attics.</li>
      <li><strong>Near Stairways:</strong> Smoke rising between floors must be detected quickly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A home with three bedrooms off one hallway should have a detector inside each bedroom plus one mounted in the hallway itself.</p>

    <h2>2. Ceiling vs. Wall Placement</h2>
    <p>
      Smoke rises, so ceiling placement is preferred. Wall-mounted detectors are acceptable when installed at the correct
      height. Poor placement reduces sensitivity and slows down detection.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ceiling Mount:</strong> Place at least 4 inches away from any wall.</li>
      <li><strong>Wall Mount:</strong> Install between 4 and 12 inches down from the ceiling.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Dead Air Spaces:</strong> Corners and tight recesses trap stagnant air.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A detector mounted directly in the corner where the ceiling meets the wall may miss rising smoke for several minutes due to dead air pockets.</p>

    <h2>3. Spacing and Distance Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
      Detectors have effective coverage ranges. Too few detectors create gaps; too many provide no additional benefit. The goal
      is even coverage without overlapping dead zones.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>General Spacing:</strong> About 30 feet apart under normal conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Hallways:</strong> At least one detector per hallway section.</li>
      <li><strong>Rooms with High Ceilings:</strong> Install closer to the highest point since hot smoke accumulates there.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A long 35-foot hallway requires more than one detector; placing one at each end maintains consistent coverage.</p>

    <h2>4. Locations to Avoid</h2>
    <p>
      Certain spots create false alarms or block proper airflow. Avoiding these locations improves reliability and reduces
      nuisance triggers.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bathrooms:</strong> Steam interferes with detection.</li>
      <li><strong>Kitchens:</strong> Heat and cooking vapors cause false alarms.</li>
      <li><strong>HVAC Vents:</strong> Airflow can divert smoke away from the sensor.</li>
      <li><strong>Drafty Areas:</strong> Near windows, fans, or exterior doors.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A detector placed directly outside a bathroom will frequently trigger from shower steam, leading homeowners to disable it.</p>

    <h2>5. Basement and Garage Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      Basements and garages have specific hazards such as fuel sources, appliances, and mechanical equipment. Placement focuses
      on catching smoke early without interference from normal operation.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basements:</strong> Install at the base of the stairs on the ceiling.</li>
      <li><strong>Garages:</strong> Use heat detectors instead of smoke detectors to avoid false alarms from vehicle exhaust.</li>
      <li><strong>Utility Areas:</strong> Keep detectors clear of furnaces and water heaters.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A ceiling-mounted detector at the bottom of basement stairs detects smoke rising from a mechanical room before the fire spreads to the main floor.</p>

    <h2>Bottom Line: Consistent Coverage Saves Time</h2>
    <p>
      Proper detector placement provides early warning and extra minutes to escape. The fundamentals are straightforward:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Install detectors inside every bedroom and outside sleeping areas</li>
      <li>Place at least one detector on every level of the home</li>
      <li>Mount detectors on ceilings whenever possible</li>
      <li>Avoid dead air pockets, drafts, and high-steam areas</li>
      <li>Use heat detectors in garages instead of smoke detectors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When detectors are positioned according to these rules, they provide consistent early detection across the entire home.
    </p>

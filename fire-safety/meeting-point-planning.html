    <h1>Meeting Point Planning: How to Choose a Safe Place to Regroup After a Fire</h1>

    <p>
      A fire meeting point prevents the most dangerous mistake people make during a fire: going back inside to “look for”
      someone who already escaped. A proper meeting point removes confusion, keeps everyone accounted for, and gives
      firefighters critical information. Before choosing one, make sure your exits are already mapped using the
      <a href="/fire-safety/identifying-primary-exits.html">primary exits guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. The Meeting Point Must Be Far Enough Away to Be Safe</h2>

    <p>
      Your home can fully engulf faster than people expect. Heat, flames, and collapsing structure demand distance.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Choose a spot 25–50 feet away from the home.</li>
      <li>Ideally across the street or at the end of the driveway.</li>
      <li>Never place the meeting point behind vehicles—they may explode from heat.</li>
      <li>Ensure the location is safe from falling debris or radiant heat.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      “Right outside the door” is not a meeting point—it’s a hazard.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Pick a Fixed Landmark, Not an Abstract Spot</h2>

    <p>
      People under panic need an obvious, unchanging target.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A large tree, mailbox, or utility pole works well.</li>
      <li>Use something visible from every major exit.</li>
      <li>Avoid fences, bushes, or dark areas children may struggle to identify.</li>
      <li>Make sure nighttime visibility is adequate.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The landmark should be clear even in smoke-dimmed lighting.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Ensure Every Family Member Knows the Location</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Walk the household to the meeting point during drills.</li>
      <li>Repeat until children go there automatically.</li>
      <li>Assign one adult to count heads once everyone arrives.</li>
      <li>Teach: “If we get separated, go to the meeting point and stay there.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This prevents anyone from wandering back toward the home.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Choose Backup Meeting Points for Multi-Level Homes</h2>

    <p>
      Secondary exits may lead to different sides of the property.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Select a primary meeting point and one backup point.</li>
      <li>Backup should only be used if the primary is blocked or unsafe.</li>
      <li>Teach kids which side-exits or window exits lead where.</li>
      <li>Use the same counting process at either point.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is especially important for homes with basement exits or second-floor window ladders.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Practice Using the Meeting Point in Real Drills</h2>

    <p>
      A meeting point is worthless unless used under fire-like conditions.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Practice nighttime drills so kids learn the route in the dark.</li>
      <li>Crawl low and move as if smoke were present.</li>
      <li>Have adults guide younger children straight to the point.</li>
      <li>End every drill with a headcount at the landmark.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Combine this with the 
      <a href="/fire-safety/home-fire-drill-guide.html">home fire drill guide</a>
      for full walk-through instructions.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Quick Meeting Point Checklist</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>25–50 feet from home</li>
      <li>Visible from all major exits</li>
      <li>Marked by a fixed landmark</li>
      <li>Safe from heat, debris, and vehicles</li>
      <li>Backup point chosen</li>
      <li>Practiced during drills</li>
    </ul>
